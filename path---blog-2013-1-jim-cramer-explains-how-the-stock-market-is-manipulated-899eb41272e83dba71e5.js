Similarly if I was long, I would go in and take a bunch of stops and make sure they were higher. It takes about $10 million in capital to affect it, it’s a fun game, it’s a lucrative game. You can maybe move it up and then fade it, I’m going to boost the futures and then the real market takes it down. That creates a very negative view. I would encourage anyone who’s in a hedge fund to do it, because it’s legal, and a very quick way to make money.</p>\n<p>What’s important when you’re in that hedge fund mode, is not to do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, it’s important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. What would you do in you’re in that situation and you feel that you’re desperate. The great thing about the market is it’s got nothing to do with the actual stock.</p>\n<p>In two-weeks all the buyers will come to their senses and realise that everything they heard was a lie, it’s just fiction and fiction and fiction. It’s important for people to recognise that the way the market really works is to have that nexus of hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders that can push it down and leak it to the press, get it on CNBC, and then you have that vicious cycle down.</p>\n</blockquote>",frontmatter:{title:"Jim Cramer explains how the stock market is manipulated",date:"January 16, 2013",passthroughUrl:"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOS8QgAQO-k"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/2013/1/jim-cramer-explains-how-the-stock-market-is-manipulated/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/1/why-the-wsj-got-the-iphone-demand-is-crashing-story-wrong/"},frontmatter:{title:"Why the WSJ got the 'iPhone demand is crashing' story wrong",passthroughUrl:"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/01/15/did-the-wsj-get-punkd-on-apple-or-is-it-rotten-to-the-core/",type:null}},next:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/1/apples-churning-of-the-gut/"},frontmatter:{title:"Apple's churning of the gut",passthroughUrl:"http://eliainsider.com/2013/01/16/apples-churning-gut/",type:null}}}}}});
