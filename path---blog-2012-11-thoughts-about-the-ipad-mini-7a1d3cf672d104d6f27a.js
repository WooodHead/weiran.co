The angle in upright is more obtuse and natural, also making the iPad more stable. I wish they made a black one though.</li>\n<li>The weight reduction is the biggest difference you notice, Apple definitely have to focus on reducing the weight of the next 10” iPad over anything else. My iPad 3 feels incredibly heavy after using the mini.</li>\n<li>It comes with an iPhone style charger (5W), not surprising considering the battery is under two-thirds of the capacity of the iPad 2.</li>\n<li>I will probably regret not getting the cellular model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The benefits of the lightweight iPad mini are apparent immediately. I don’t think it’s the size or price that will drive sales of the iPad mini, but once you hold it the lack of weight makes it a very attractive device.</p>\n<p>In combination with the lower price, I think the iPad mini has the ability to become the defacto iPad in the next 18 months to two years. If next year Apple can produce a Retina model with a similar weight and a A6X processor at the same price, it will be <em>the</em> iPad.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Thoughts about the iPad mini",date:"November 02, 2012",passthroughUrl:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/2012/11/thoughts-about-the-ipad-mini/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2012/11/uk-search-safari-extension/"},frontmatter:{title:"UK Search Safari Extension",passthroughUrl:"https://github.com/randomsequence/UK-Search-Safari-Extension",type:null}},next:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2012/11/crappy-computers/"},frontmatter:{title:"Crappy computers",passthroughUrl:"http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2012/11/04/crappy_computers/",type:null}}}}}});
