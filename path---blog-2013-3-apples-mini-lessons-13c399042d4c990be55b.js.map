As Apple produces more of each model, it’s profit margin increases to the point where the price can be reduced.

The iPad 2 remained a strong seller even though it lacked the spectacular Retina display, but with the release of the iPad 4 Apple introduced the iPad mini, a new, cheaper iPad which is now rumoured to be the best selling model.</p>\\n<p>While it’s clear that the mini has several technical advantages over the existing models: weight, size, appearance have all been improved, it got significant mindshare well before it was announced. The endless rumours, mockups, fake photographs, supply chain leaks, all culminating in an Apple product announcement covered by the media worldwide.

Even if the hardware is based on an existing iPhone, Apple has learned with the iPad mini, that it’s worthwhile to take a short term hit in profit margin to gain more market and mind share with a new model. Apple used this strategy with the iPod as well, releasing an iPod mini which itself cannibalised their own iPod sales and then became the dominant model. I can only speculate why Apple changed their strategy with the iPhone, perhaps they went too far in chasing higher profit margins. Whatever the reason, Apple are showing signs that it’s learned from that mistake, and they are developing a new iPhone model that has the opportunity to take the iPhone’s success to the next level.</p>\\n<p><em>If you’ve read this far, you should probably follow me on Twitter: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/weiran\\\">@weiran</a>.</em></p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Apple's mini lessons\",\"date\":\"March 05, 2013\",\"passthroughUrl\":null}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/2013/3/apples-mini-lessons/\",\"previous\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/2013/3/uk-court-of-appeal-rejects-teslas-case-against-top-gear/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"UK Court of Appeal rejects Tesla's case against Top Gear\",\"passthroughUrl\":\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/152.html\"}},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/2013/3/gnome-founder-uses-macs/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Gnome founder uses Macs\",\"passthroughUrl\":\"http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2013/Mar-05.html\"}}}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---blog-2013-3-apples-mini-lessons-13c399042d4c990be55b.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"weiran.co\",\"author\":\"Weiran Zhang\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/weiran/git/weiran/weiran.co/src/pages/blog/2013/3/apples-mini-lessons/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/c1ed2469-80ff-40a3-98f1-4ec62c4809ef-83f66301753343eca54a02baf2cf03dc-d9514.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 46%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"c1ed2469 80ff 40a3 98f1 4ec62c4809ef\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/c1ed2469-80ff-40a3-98f1-4ec62c4809ef-83f66301753343eca54a02baf2cf03dc-fb8a0.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/c1ed2469-80ff-40a3-98f1-4ec62c4809ef-83f66301753343eca54a02baf2cf03dc-1a291.png 148w,\\n/static/c1ed2469-80ff-40a3-98f1-4ec62c4809ef-83f66301753343eca54a02baf2cf03dc-2bc4a.png 295w,\\n/static/c1ed2469-80ff-40a3-98f1-4ec62c4809ef-83f66301753343eca54a02baf2cf03dc-fb8a0.png 590w,\\n/static/c1ed2469-80ff-40a3-98f1-4ec62c4809ef-83f66301753343eca54a02baf2cf03dc-d9514.png 600w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Since the iPhone 3G, Apple has recycled old iPhone models to be the low end model.
