And after taking inspiration from my friend <a href="https://eddielee.me/hello-gatsby">Eddie moving his blog to Gatsby</a>, I decided — under the pretence of saving money — to migrate my website to Gatsby as well. </p>\n<h2>Gatsby</h2>\n<p><a href="Gatsby">Gatsby</a> is a static site generator for React. You design and build your web site locally, including all the content in Markdown, and the build process produces a pre-built static website that can be hosted (in my case, for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>).</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog">Gatsby Starter Blog template project</a> is an excellent way to learn about Gatsby, and you may be able to tell this website is heavily based on it.</p>\n<h2>The Migration</h2>\n<p>Gatsby content is defined by Markdown files on the filesystem. Squarespace exports your content into a <a href="https://devtidbits.com/2011/03/16/the-wordpress-extended-rss-wxr-exportimport-xml-document-format-decoded-and-explained/">WordPress export format</a> file. But even if you used Markdown content blocks in Squarespace, the export will only give you content as HTML. Damn.</p>\n<p>So how do I convert Squarespace’s export into something I can use with Gatsby?</p>\n<h2>WordPress to Gatsby Migrator</h2>\n<p>An old saying goes: “there’s an NPM package for everything”. In this case <a href="https://github.com/domchristie/turndown">Turndown</a> for converting HTML into Markdown, is exactly what was needed. Sprinkle a few more packages to help parse the RSS format export, string them all together, and out came my new tool <a href="https://github.com/weiran/wordpress-gatsby-migrater">wordpress-gatsby-migrater</a>.</p>\n<p>Modern programming 101: why reinvent the wheel when someone smarter than you has already reinveted it.</p>\n<p>After running it, with only a few tweaks to the starter project and the new website is finished.</p>\n<p>Was it all worth it? If I converted the number of hours I spent on this and how much Squarespace costs per month, it would probably have paid for years of Squarespace service. </p>\n<p>But doing this was easily way more fun, and it may even get me blogging more.</p>',fields:{slug:"/blog/2018/6/gatsby/"},frontmatter:{date:"02 June, 2018",title:"Moving from Squarespace to Gatsby",type:null,passthroughUrl:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"I had some time off over Christmas, so I decided to scratch an itch I’ve had for a while now.

Apple flippled flopped between AMD and Nvidia as their supplier, before finally settling down with AMD for the retina iMac.</p>\n<p>AMD make fine graphics cards, but in recent years Nvidia had the edge in terms of performance, heat, and power usage. The current top of the range AMD graphics card in the iMac, the Radeon R9 M395X, just doesn’t compare well to Nvidia’s 970M, even though on the spec sheet the AMD card should be faster. But in comparison the AMD card is slower, more power hungry, and thermally throttles when pushed.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/35accf27-eab1-4825-8ebb-039f49a036d4-05fa7156e1edd576635342934ce81e41-a402e.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="35accf27 eab1 4825 8ebb 039f49a036d4"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/35accf27-eab1-4825-8ebb-039f49a036d4-05fa7156e1edd576635342934ce81e41-f8fb9.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/35accf27-eab1-4825-8ebb-039f49a036d4-05fa7156e1edd576635342934ce81e41-e8976.jpg 148w,\n/static/35accf27-eab1-4825-8ebb-039f49a036d4-05fa7156e1edd576635342934ce81e41-63df2.jpg 295w,\n/static/35accf27-eab1-4825-8ebb-039f49a036d4-05fa7156e1edd576635342934ce81e41-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\n/static/35accf27-eab1-4825-8ebb-039f49a036d4-05fa7156e1edd576635342934ce81e41-85e3d.jpg 885w,\n/static/35accf27-eab1-4825-8ebb-039f49a036d4-05fa7156e1edd576635342934ce81e41-a402e.jpg 1000w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>AMD Polaris</h2>\n<p>AMD’s long term solution was a <a href="amd-polaris">major overhaul</a> of their archectecture called Polaris, to improve what they call Performance per Watt. With the release of the desktop AMD RX480 and RX470, there’s no doubt that AMD have made up a lot of ground on Nvidia, yet a noticable gap still exists when you compare the latest generation of both companies.</p>\n<p>This isn’t likely to deter Apple in choosing AMD as their GPU supplier again though, as the preferential pricing from AMD sweetens and sourness from not having the best avalilable.</p>\n<p>There’s also the potential of custom APUs with the release of Zen next year, with a big CPU and GPU packaged into one chip like the Xbox One and PS4, but that’s another topic entirely.</p>\n<h2>What will Apple pick</h2>\n<p>The problem for Apple, is the new mobile Polaris GPUs aren’t very fast. The mobile version of the RX480 is based on a cut down chip with half of almost everything, making it much slower than the outgoing R9 M395X.</p>\n<p>Apple will need to use the desktop AMD GPUs again to even maintain performance with the previous generation, let alone improve it.</p>\n<p>This year is the first time in a while where they can use desktop AMD GPUs. The RX470 is rated at 120W <a href="tdp">TDP</a>, which compares with the current M395X’s 125W TDP. If Apple can put a RX470 into the iMac, that will offer a 50% performance increase over the M395X for roughly the same power usage.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Will Apple use a RX470? I hope so, although they can get away with a slower RX460 and still improve over the previous generation, the iMac can handle the RX470 and it would be a shame if it wasn’t an option at least.</p>\n<p>The base GPU would then be the RX480M, which is comparable to the outgoing M380, and I’d imagine the RX460 or similar as the mid range.</p>\n<p>This does pose a problem with branding, with the RX460 and RX470 being much faster than the bottom of the range RX480M. So like the Mac Pro I expect AMD to allow Apple to have their own model names, perhaps W460, W470, and W480:</p>\n<p>Good: AMD RX480M 2GB (W460)<br>\nBetter: AMD RX460 4GB (W470)<br>\nBest: AMD RX470 8GB (W480)</p>',fields:{slug:"/blog/2016/9/speculation-about-the-next-gpu-in-the-imac/"},frontmatter:{date:"06 September, 2016",title:"Speculation about the next GPU in the iMac",type:null,passthroughUrl:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"It wasn’t long ago that travelling on a trip longer than two weeks meant lumbering a laptop with you the whole way.

With it, you can practically never get lost, and be your own tour guide at the same time by using apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/inquire-by-tamper/id1045268097?mt=8">Inquire</a>, which shows you Wikipedia articles about places close to your current location. I love the liberating feeling of just going where the path takes me instead of meticulously following a plan, and having cellular data gives me the confidence to just follow my feet and figure out where I am later.</p>\n<h2>How to buy SIM cards</h2>\n<p>The best source of information about buying SIM cards internationally is on <a href="https://wikivoyage.org">WikiVoyage</a>. Each country’s page on WikiVoyage will have a section discussing the cheapest and easiest ways to get a data SIM. You could also use a carrier like Three UK which gives free data roaming to several countries. You just need a little bit of pre-planning to make sure you get the right SIM, with the right coverage, when you land.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/122da86c-b130-4b7b-9125-2fa0c7e823cf-54281af47c7c4397d678ed1f508233cb-a402e.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt=" Xi\'an Bell Tower "\n        title=""\n        src="/static/122da86c-b130-4b7b-9125-2fa0c7e823cf-54281af47c7c4397d678ed1f508233cb-f8fb9.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/122da86c-b130-4b7b-9125-2fa0c7e823cf-54281af47c7c4397d678ed1f508233cb-e8976.jpg 148w,\n/static/122da86c-b130-4b7b-9125-2fa0c7e823cf-54281af47c7c4397d678ed1f508233cb-63df2.jpg 295w,\n/static/122da86c-b130-4b7b-9125-2fa0c7e823cf-54281af47c7c4397d678ed1f508233cb-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\n/static/122da86c-b130-4b7b-9125-2fa0c7e823cf-54281af47c7c4397d678ed1f508233cb-85e3d.jpg 885w,\n/static/122da86c-b130-4b7b-9125-2fa0c7e823cf-54281af47c7c4397d678ed1f508233cb-a402e.jpg 1000w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Dealing with the Great Firewall</h2>\n<p>If you’re travelling in China like I am, you’ll find lots of the usual websites and services blocked or heavily throttled by the Great Firewall. Services such as Google, Dropbox, Twitter are all unusable over cellular or a WiFi connection. To get around this you’ll need a VPN able to punch a hole through the firewall, without being caught by the sophisticated deep packet analysis that blocks the majority of VPN services.</p>\n<p>I found <a href="http://expressvpn.xyz/">ExpressVPN</a> to be reliable and easy to use on iOS, it bills every 30 days and uses a combination of UDP, TCP, and IPSec transports to get around present and future firewall restrictions.</p>\n<p>If I had time, I would’ve setup <a href="https://github.com/jlund/streisand">Streisand</a> on a VM at DigitalOcean instead, but ExpressVPN worked well enough.</p>\n<p>The main problem is that using a constantly running VPN really hurts battery life, I probably got around half what I would normally expect to get, even with the excellent 4G reception in China. See the section below on charging and battery life to see ways to mitigate this.</p>\n<h1>Charging and battery life</h1>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/1de2dad1-1d95-4bce-996c-2cd86c049d28-53fa3bcc5752ec7454eb8def4d7ccaae-a402e.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt=" Labrang Monastery  "\n        title=""\n        src="/static/1de2dad1-1d95-4bce-996c-2cd86c049d28-53fa3bcc5752ec7454eb8def4d7ccaae-f8fb9.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/1de2dad1-1d95-4bce-996c-2cd86c049d28-53fa3bcc5752ec7454eb8def4d7ccaae-e8976.jpg 148w,\n/static/1de2dad1-1d95-4bce-996c-2cd86c049d28-53fa3bcc5752ec7454eb8def4d7ccaae-63df2.jpg 295w,\n/static/1de2dad1-1d95-4bce-996c-2cd86c049d28-53fa3bcc5752ec7454eb8def4d7ccaae-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\n/static/1de2dad1-1d95-4bce-996c-2cd86c049d28-53fa3bcc5752ec7454eb8def4d7ccaae-85e3d.jpg 885w,\n/static/1de2dad1-1d95-4bce-996c-2cd86c049d28-53fa3bcc5752ec7454eb8def4d7ccaae-a402e.jpg 1000w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Mobile power</h2>\n<p>When your phone or watch holds key information like your boarding pass, keeping all your devices charged up is more important than ever. I use an iPhone 6s, not a phone known for it’s long battery life. Day-to-day I never usually worry about the battery running out, but when I’m travelling a typical day is often a lot longer, and a lot more strenuous on the phone’s battery.</p>\n<p>The simpliest solution if you just have a phone is to buy a charging case, I would get the <a href="http://amzn.to/1Yz2PXg">Apple Smart Battery Case</a>. It’s integration with iOS, a design that avoids blocking antennas that would give attenuation, and the standard Lightning port for charging, make it the best overall case if you own an iPhone.</p>\n<p>But like a lot of people, I have an increasing number of devices to keep charged, such as my Apple Watch, iPad, Bluetooth headphones, and my partner’s phone and iPad as well.</p>\n<p>So I use an external battery, and my preference goes to <a href="http://amzn.to/1UgKIjZ">Xiaomi’s 10000mAh Power Bank</a>. I’ll be honest, I like it best because its design reminds of of an oversized iPod mini, a nice aluminium shell with chamfered edges and four sexy LEDs indicating battery life.

I like the proper latch, which prevents oppurtunistic theives, but also has a quick release mechanism for easy access. I like the new Fibernyte material, which is like canvas but completely waterproof and requires no maintenence. The pockets inside and outside are plenty for a bag this size, and the padding means you can store cameras, iPhones, and iPads without worry. I would also recommend a <a href="http://amzn.to/1ScaCmS">shoulder pad</a> as the strap is quite slippery, and to give a bit more comfort after carrying that for a long day.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/e4a2b036-1890-4472-9745-5739938a11de-ac868a5e3e5516df3ff9b70bc85137e2-a402e.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt=" Oasis in the Gobi desert "\n        title=""\n        src="/static/e4a2b036-1890-4472-9745-5739938a11de-ac868a5e3e5516df3ff9b70bc85137e2-f8fb9.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/e4a2b036-1890-4472-9745-5739938a11de-ac868a5e3e5516df3ff9b70bc85137e2-e8976.jpg 148w,\n/static/e4a2b036-1890-4472-9745-5739938a11de-ac868a5e3e5516df3ff9b70bc85137e2-63df2.jpg 295w,\n/static/e4a2b036-1890-4472-9745-5739938a11de-ac868a5e3e5516df3ff9b70bc85137e2-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\n/static/e4a2b036-1890-4472-9745-5739938a11de-ac868a5e3e5516df3ff9b70bc85137e2-85e3d.jpg 885w,\n/static/e4a2b036-1890-4472-9745-5739938a11de-ac868a5e3e5516df3ff9b70bc85137e2-a402e.jpg 1000w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Misc</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Travelling with a partner?

I find it hard to tell if the case is on purely by weight alone. But, you will certainly notice the bulk. It makes the iPhone feel twice as thick as it normally does, which makes it more comfortable to hold, especially with gloves on. Personally I don’t like how bulky the case is, but those with bigger hands might prefer it.</p>\n<p>The second problem is how close the edge wraps over the front, this makes doing edge gestures much harder, something common in iOS 7 for common actions like swiping back in Safari.</p>\n<p>The case is reasonably well made, although it does feel a bit flimsy around the volume and wake/sleep buttons. Expect those areas to suffer first.</p>\n<p>Overall if you’re in the market for an iPhone case and fancy something with an exotic material, the Snugg Bamboo Case is a pretty good case.

Why does Google need to remind itself that it needs be good, and why it’s their slogan?</p>\n<p>Google’s strategy is to sell advertising. To do that, it needs to collect user data in order to show relevant adverts so it’s customers will buy more ads. The nature of this strategy pushes Google towards being evil. It <em>has</em> to collect very personal and sensitive information about it’s users, and some of the best minds in technology are working at better ways to collect information and sell ads.</p>\n<p>It still boggles my mind how many people don’t see Google’s motivations, and what they may or may not do with all the data Google is collecting about them.

To them, “Don’t be evil” doesn’t have (or need) a paticular meaning.</p>\n<p>But the users who are conscious of Google’s strategy, this is where the motto “Don’t be evil” really starts to make sense.

What are they going to do with this data? Who are they going to sell it to?

Google’s ongoing success with online services is evidence that “Don’t be evil” was a brilliant move.</p>\n<p>But we have a choice, a choice to use products from companies with a strategy that doesn’t push them towards being evil, companies that don’t need “Don’t be evil” as their motto.</p>\n<p>Vote with your data, don’t give it to Google.</p>",fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/6/why-google-needs-dont-be-evil/"},frontmatter:{date:"19 June, 2013",title:"Why Google Needs 'Don't Be Evil'",type:null,passthroughUrl:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Lots of people were worried when the  new-old Mac Pro  was released last June.

As Apple produces more of each model, it’s profit margin increases to the point where the price can be reduced. This has worked very well, with <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1130391-apple-disappointed-in-part-due-to-supply-constraints">the iPhone 4 supply constrained in the entirety of Q4 2012</a> despite being two-years old, some people want an iPhone while paying as little as possible.</p>\n<p>But while it may be profitable, no-one gets excited about buying a two year old phone, you don’t get the media attention that a new phone would create and it’s much harder to market a new price point rather than a new product.</p>\n<p>Apple has taken this approach with iPads as well, the iPad 2 being demoted to a low end model when the iPad 3 was released. The iPad 2 remained a strong seller even though it lacked the spectacular Retina display, but with the release of the iPad 4 Apple introduced the iPad mini, a new, cheaper iPad which is now rumoured to be the best selling model.</p>\n<p>While it’s clear that the mini has several technical advantages over the existing models: weight, size, appearance have all been improved, it got significant mindshare well before it was announced. The endless rumours, mockups, fake photographs, supply chain leaks, all culminating in an Apple product announcement covered by the media worldwide. Even if Apple had a comparable existing product to the mini, discounting that model by $100 wouldn’t have generated anywhere near as much attention as releasing a new product.</p>\n<p>This is why I think the next budget iPhone will be a brand new model. Even if the hardware is based on an existing iPhone, Apple has learned with the iPad mini, that it’s worthwhile to take a short term hit in profit margin to gain more market and mind share with a new model. Apple used this strategy with the iPod as well, releasing an iPod mini which itself cannibalised their own iPod sales and then became the dominant model. I can only speculate why Apple changed their strategy with the iPhone, perhaps they went too far in chasing higher profit margins. Whatever the reason, Apple are showing signs that it’s learned from that mistake, and they are developing a new iPhone model that has the opportunity to take the iPhone’s success to the next level.</p>\n<p><em>If you’ve read this far, you should probably follow me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/weiran">@weiran</a>.</em></p>',

Certainly not me…",html:'<p>Who would’ve bet that Google would be the first company to release a competitor to Apple’s MacBook Pro with Retina display? Certainly not me. For whatever reason, other ‘brands’ seem reluctant to compete with Apple in this new class of notebook computer. Sony, Asus, and Lenovo all have notebooks at similar prices, but none have a high density display and none have only solid state storage.</p>\n<p>But why? Why have some of the biggest technology companies been unable to compete with Apple, especially considering the display itself doesn’t contain any Apple intellectual property. The answer is found when reading any <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/25/4023830/google-chromebook-pixel-review">reviews</a> of Google’s Chromebook Pixel.</p>\n<p>On the surface, Google’s Chromebook Pixel is a highly impressive piece of hardware. The industrial design is attractive and distinctive, the build quality is up there with the best, and as a bonus the ugly Google logo is nowhere to be seen. But almost all of the reviews mention the same three problems: price, battery life, and the operating system.</p>\n<p>I believe £1049 (or $1299) is a reasonable price for hardware like the Pixel, but the value proposition is poor when compared with a MacBook Pro. The Pixel runs an OS that is essentially just a very good web browser. While Chrome OS is improving, I think it’s still a few years too early for most people to use as their main or only operating system. Mac OS X is a better OS with more flexibility, and is found on computers costing about the same amount for similar or better hardware.</p>\n<p>If another manufacturer were to offer a high DPI laptop, they’d have to use Windows 8. The new Metro side of Windows 8 scales well with Retina displays, but the old Windows desktop has never supported high DPI displays, and I don’t think it’s about to.</p>\n<p>The final piece of the puzzle is battery life, something that’s always suffered when using bleeding edge technology. Chromebooks started off as low cost, big battery laptops, but with the Chromebook Pixel, Google has run into a technical hurdle they can’t surmount to get anywhere near the 8-10 hours their prototype Chromebook CR-48 did. Reviews have found it gets around four hours, which is about 25% less than a 13” Retina MacBook Pro, which has a 20% bigger battery. Considering the Pixel uses a slower, lower power CPU either the display uses a lot more power or Chrome OS is inefficient on x86 CPUs.</p>\n<p>I doubt battery life would be much better if the Pixel ran Windows 8. Apple has such a head start in this area due to their experience with integrating hardware and software, that if any competitor were to release a product right now, it would have to compromise performance, weight, size, price, or battery life.</p>\n<p>Google are currently the only company that is willing to take on Apple and welcome in the brave new world of notebook computing. I see no mention of the actual manufacturer or whether Google are making a profit on it (I think their margins are very slim). This is just a hobby for Google like the Apple TV is a hobby for Apple, but it’s nice seeing someone else <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2752-a-good-hockey-player-plays-where-the-puck">skating to where the puck is going</a> instead of where it is.</p>\n<p><em>If you’ve read this far, you should probably follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/weiran">@weiran</a></em></p>',fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/2/chromebook-pixel/"},frontmatter:{date:"26 February, 2013",title:"Only Apple and Google are skating to where the puck is going",type:null,passthroughUrl:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Matt Drance on Sony’s strange Playstation 4 announcement: People would have happily waited longer for a comprehensive, exciting product…",html:"<p>Matt Drance on Sony’s strange Playstation 4 announcement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People would have happily waited longer for a comprehensive, exciting product launch.

It reminds me of <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Steve Jobs when he was pissed off</a>. But while on the surface Musk’s arguments seem compelling, digging a bit deeper shows cracks and the same sort of biased analysis and prejudice that resulted in Broder’s original conclusions.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Greenfield at The Atlantic Wire had a look at the data presented by Musk, and <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/02/elon-musks-data-doesnt-back-his-claims-new-york-times-fakery/62149/">found it less than conclusive</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not all of Musk’s data is entirely convincing and the parts that are don’t point to a malicious plot. In the end, it looks like Broder made some compromises to get from the Newark charging station to the Milford one, in both speed and temperature.

These claims were <a href="http://transmission.blogs.topgear.com/2011/04/02/tesla-vs-top-gear-andy-wilman-on-our-current-legal-action/">refuted by Top Gear</a>, and <a href="http://transmission.blogs.topgear.com/2012/02/23/tesla-libel-action-against-top-gear-fails-again/">thrown out of court twice</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr Justice Tugendhat said that Tesla’s second attempt to formulate their malicious falsehood case on damage was so “vague” and so “gravely deficient” that “it is impossible to say that it has a real prospect of success or is in respect of a real and substantial tort.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem Tesla and Elon Musk now face is the boy who cried wolf syndrome (I just made that up).

I write mostly in Markdown, an open data format that is stored in text files. It’s unlikely that I won’t be able to read or edit what I’ve written in 50 years time because no one supports that file format anymore. To me, my data is timeless.</p>\n<p>However the device and software I use is only temporal. It’s likely in 10 years time we’ll be using a different operating system. Whether that software is open or locked down, it doesn’t matter as long as my data is ‘free’.</p>\n<p>The advantages of using a walled-garden approach like Apple outweigh the freedom offered by root access. At least for now.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Berners-Lee also spoke out against the trend of writing a native application for every platform — that is, an iPhone and iPad app for Apple’s iOS devices, another for Android, and so on. It’s a duplication of effort, and it’s “boring for developers” to write and test similar code for each device, he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would argue that it’s much more ‘boring’ testing designs for web browsers, as it involves testing on several different browsers and maybe even different version of each browser.</p>\n<p>Writing a native app is currently a necessity if you want to create something that’s best of breed. None of the HTML5 frameworks or even proprietary cross-platform frameworks even come close to writing a native app.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Berners-Lee pointed to the Financial Times’ award-winning mobile site at m.ft.com as an example of what can be achieved. “Once you load the page, it pulls in all the pages of today’s paper and sticks them on your device…just as though you’re running an app,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Use the fact that, more and more, you can do [in HTML5] the things that a native app can do.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I applaud the <a href="app.ft.com">Financial Times’ mobile site</a>, it still doesn’t compare well to a <a href="http://the-magazine.org">good native app</a>. There are issues with the layout, performance, and responsiveness. It is clearly not a native app and rather a HTML web app, so saying it can do everything a native app can do is rather disingenuous.</p>\n<h2>Utopian future</h2>\n<p>Berners-Lee promotes his own creations, and he’s well within his rights to. In the long term the web should be protected, but I don’t think it’s as ‘open’ as he claims it to be, most websites we visit are closed source and controlled by corporations.</p>\n<p>Native apps are just another way to write high performance web apps that run on mobile devices, it solves a problem we have now until we have the capability to solve it in a more cross-platform way in the future.</p>',fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/2/berners-lee/"},frontmatter:{date:"01 February, 2013",title:"Tim Berners-Lee on the future of the web",type:null,passthroughUrl:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Mike Lombardo explains exactly why Eminem is such a good lyricist.",html:"<p>Mike Lombardo explains exactly why Eminem is such a good lyricist.</p>",fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/2/why-eminem-is-one-of-the-most-impressive-lyricists-ever/"},frontmatter:{date:"01 February, 2013",title:"Why Eminem is one of the most impressive lyricists ever",type:null,passthroughUrl:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Marco Arment speculates that a 5” iPhone isn’t as unlikely as it seems, and mocks up how it might look.

Apple’s results for this quarter should be viewed on a weekly basis due to an extra week in Q1 2012, and on that basis, the company posted solid growth across many of its divisions. While Apple’s Q2 2013 guidance seems light, it needs to be viewed in the context of last year’s iPhone 4S launch and the presence of the iPad mini. And Apple’s aggressive operating expense and capital expenditure forecasts are implying that the company is readying for a material change in the second half of fiscal 2013, something that we believe is tied to the launch of a new product category, something that Apple has done every 3 years since 2001.

First, we heard “good news” from Nokia, which <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/technology/nokia-sees-results-from-new-smartphone-line.html">reported shipments of 4.4 million Lumia phones in the year-end quarter</a>. Never mind that we are talking less than 2 percent market share for Nokia or that sales were boosted by heavy discounting, often down to $99 at retail — less than half what competing phones sell for. This is good news in the land of Nokia</p>\n<p>Similarly, Cnet was very excited about Samsung’s announcement that the Galaxy S phone line had <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57563765-94/samsung-weve-sold-100-million-galaxy-s-smartphones/">crossed the 100 million mark in total sales</a>. The phone is so desirable, “Sales of the flagship Galaxy S3 reached 30 million units in 5 months, and 40 million in 7 months, with average daily sales of about 190,000 units.” You’d think that it’s the hottest thing going with those numbers. Of course, as we were just discussing above, in the quarter just ended, Apple will have sold about as many iPhone 5′s as Samsung has sold Galaxy S3′s in 7 months! This is what the “experts” are already calling trouble and they haven’t seen the numbers yet.</p>\n<p>Now, of course, Samsung is also selling the prior generation S2, which Cnet tells us, “…is described as a steady bet after recording sales of over 40 million in 20 months.” So that’s about 2 million a month for that model to go with the 17 milllion S3 phones Samsung apparently moved in Q4. In other words, if we just compare the last two generations of phones, Apple sold somewhere around 35-45 million last quarter while Samsung moved about 23 million. It’s certainly true that Samsung has a number of less-expensive entry models and will outsell Apple in raw numbers. But when one looks at “profit share” and wonders why Apple will continue to earn more of it in smartphones than Samsung, those numbers tell the story.</p>\n</blockquote>',fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/1/why-the-wsj-got-the-iphone-demand-is-crashing-story-wrong/"},frontmatter:{date:"16 January, 2013",title:"Why the WSJ got the 'iPhone demand is crashing' story wrong",type:null,passthroughUrl:"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/01/15/did-the-wsj-get-punkd-on-apple-or-is-it-rotten-to-the-core/"}}},{node:{excerpt:"Yesterday, Wall Street Journal’s claim that Apple had “halved” orders for iPhone 5 displays has caused a few stirs around here.

The lower component orders could signal that an “iPhone 5S” can be expected sooner rather than later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although as <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/14/iphone-2013">John Gruber points out</a>, a new iPhone is almost certainly going to use the same display as the iPhone 5.</p>\n<p>BGR expands on the <a href="http://bgr.com/2013/01/14/iphone-5-analysis-component-cuts-291307/">questionable maths used to reason that Apple cut display orders in half</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So if the most likely number of 4-inch screens Apple is reasonably expected to sell in March quarter is around 30 to 40 million units, why did Nikkei publish a report stating that Apple had halved its display orders for the quarter from 65 million units? Nikkei was quite specific about the 65 million number. And it clearly tied it to iPhone 5 component orders, not total iPhone or iPhone 5 and iPod touch orders.</p>\n<p>In what world did Apple expect to order components for 65 million iPhone 5 handsets in the seasonally soft March quarter?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the weirdness of the math is why the current version of the WSJ article no longer cites the 65 million unit figure. Sometime between Sunday at 8:00 p.m. EST and Monday at 7:00 a.m., the Journal decided to drop the number from its article. But if the 65 million number is not right, is the estimate for halving March orders correct?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And finally from November last year, Joe Springer from Seeking Alpha expands on the incentives for keeping Apple’s stock price low until at least January 19:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What kind of money are we talking? Let’s use the more than 60,000 calls with a $600 strike price. If Apple goes to $700 before January 19, then those options have an intrinsic value of:</p>\n<p>60,000 (call options) X 100 (shares per option) X $100 (intrinsic value per share) = $600,000,000</p>\n<p>Six hundred million dollars not in the institutional call writers’ pockets. Whereas, if Apple stays put, then runs to $700 after the expiration date, the call writers get the capital gain from the common stock they covered with, AND the entire amount for which they sold the option. And this is only one strike price we calculated - together this is billions of dollars for a two month delay in an Apple surge.</p>\n<p>But now, however, the gains of the Summer have come back in and Apple’s share price has only to stay flat for the next two months for all those call options to expire worthless. The institutional money managers that wrote those options, if they were to try to manipulate Apple’s share price, have a lot of incentive to keep Apple in place for a short time, then drive it higher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So there you have it. There may be some truth in the Wall Street Journal’s claim that Apple has cut orders for iPhone 5 displays, and (going against all previous experience) Tim Cook might have been wrong about iPhone demand. But given that the foundation of this story is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-story-thats-killing-apple-today-is-a-month-old-2013-1">over a month old</a>, the history of unreliable supply chain rumours, and the huge incentives to manipulate Apple’s stock to keep it low until a few days before the next earnings call, I know which theory I believe.</p>',fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/1/apple-wall-street-journal/"},frontmatter:{date:"15 January, 2013",title:"The suspicious timing of Wall Street Journal's piece about reduced iPhone orders",type:null,passthroughUrl:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Nice timeline of Apple’s products by Pop Chart Lab.",html:"<p>Nice timeline of Apple’s products by Pop Chart Lab.</p>",fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/1/a-history-of-apple-products/"},frontmatter:{date:"15 January, 2013",title:"A history of Apple products",type:null,passthroughUrl:"http://popchartlab.com/collections/prints/products/the-insanely-great-history-of-apple"}}},{node:{excerpt:"Aaron Swartz was not the super hacker breathlessly described in the Government’s indictment and forensic reports, and his actions did not…",html:"<blockquote>\n<p>Aaron Swartz was not the super hacker breathlessly described in the Government’s indictment and forensic reports, and his actions did not pose a real danger to JSTOR, MIT or the public.

The biggest one being the new iMac…",html:"<h3>New iMacs and MacBook Pros</h3>\n<p>I think everyone welcomed updates to long neglected Macs in Apple’s line-up. The biggest one being the new iMac and MacBook Pro 13”. Only the new MacBook Pro with Retina Display is a big enough update to warrant upgrading from the previous generation. If, like me, you have a 2011 iMac, you probably aren’t going to rush out for the new iMac.</p>\n<p>The new Nvidia GTX 680MX GPU in the top of the range 27” iMac is a new chip that isn’t even released yet, it looks like it should have around 80% of the performance of the desktop GTX 680 (already one of the fastest GPUs available). There are no longer any Macs that come with AMD Radeon graphics (unless you count the Mac Pro).</p>\n<p>If you have deep pockets, the MacBook Pro 13” with Retinal display is now the best choice laptop for most users, displacing the MacBook Air because of it’s incredible display. It does have some major shortcomings compared to the 15” model, the lack of a quad core processor, 8GB RAM limit, lack of a discrete GPU, but if you can live within those bounds its form factor is very appealing.</p>\n<h3>Mac mini gets some stage time</h3>\n<p>The Mac mini has had an interesting update. In the past the updates are unannounced and silently appear on the website, this time Phil Schiller announced a big update to the range with Ivy Bridge, USB3, and a big upgrade to the mid-range model. Previously only the server model came with a quad core processor, and at quite a price premium. Now for £679 you can get a Mac with a CPU as fast as those in the MacBook Pro 15”, and in many ways faster than the current Mac Pros. Add your own SSD and 16GB of RAM and you have a small, compact, but very powerful computer. Just try not to play too many games on it.</p>\n<h3>The iPad mini</h3>\n<p>The biggest surprise of the iPad mini is probably that it’s named iPad mini. That was the only thing left to imagination after all the rumours and leaks. The iPad mini reminds me a lot of the iPod mini’s launch, a smaller and lighter version of an existing product. The reduction in weight will make the biggest difference, my current third generation iPad’s 650g heft is significant and the price to pay for having a retina display. Other advantages include a much smaller battery that will help charging times, and hopefully a longer battery life as well.</p>\n<p>The pricing has lead to more questions than answers. It was obvious that Apple couldn’t compete with Google and Amazon by selling the iPad mini at a loss, and their insistence on using high quality materials and not compromising means the iPad mini is fair bit pricier than it’s direct competition. I think Apple will sell its entire inventory of iPad minis for Christmas, they won’t be able to make them fast enough. They still have a massive advantage with their ecosystem, even combining the rest of the market you don’t get close to the quantity and quality that’s available in the App Store and iTunes Store.</p>\n<p>Apple have decided to maintain their famous profit margin on each device instead of (literally) going for broke like their competitors, I think for the initial iPad mini this is a perfectly shrewd move, but for next years device they may have to be slightly more competitive on price.</p>\n<h3>The new new iPad</h3>\n<p>Well shit, I no longer own the newest iPad and as an insult to injury Apple has slashed the cost of refurbished third generation iPads which means the resale value has also been hit. Do I care? No, the third generation iPad is still a great iPad (although a little CPU constrained), and I’m pleased that Apple is capable of updating their iPads so quickly now. I think this does mean that Apple’s new iPad release schedule is always going to be in the autumn rather than spring, probably to help with seasonal sales.</p>\n<p>I did briefly consider selling my third generation iPad for the newer model, but I will probably wait until the new new new iPad that’s now due out in a year.</p>\n<h3>The presentation</h3>\n<p>With each post Steve Jobs presentation, the character and style of Tim Cook and company gets more and more refined. Phil Schiller is really settling into his role in the presentation, and I think he had the best performance of the day. What I would like to see is a bit more secrecy and suspense, there are so many leaks from Apple’s supply line that it’s almost impossible to watch an Apple presentation without knowing the majority of what’s being announced, and that’s a real shame.</p>",fields:{slug:"/blog/thoughts-apple-oct-2012/"},frontmatter:{date:"25 October, 2012",title:"Thoughts about Apple's October 2012 event",type:null,passthroughUrl:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"The best Twitter app for the Mac is out on the Mac App Store.

Requiring iPhone users to look directly at handsets for directions and manually move through each step — while Android users enjoyed native voice-guided instructions — put Apple at a clear disadvantage in the mobile space. And having chosen Google as its original mapping partner, the iPhone maker was now in a position where an archrival was calling the shots on functionality important to the iOS maps feature set.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And this caused Apple — which typically enjoys very tight control over its products — no end of philosophical discomfort, sources say. Apple pushed Google hard to provide the data it needed to bring voice-guided navigation to iOS.
