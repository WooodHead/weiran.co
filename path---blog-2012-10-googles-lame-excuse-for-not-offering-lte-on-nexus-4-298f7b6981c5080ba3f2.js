So they pivoted it from a BlackBerry clone into a full touch-screen OS and shopped it out to the carriers and manufacturers as a way for them to get a smartphone on the market to compete with Apple that they could still shove their crapware and carrier billing systems into.</p>\n<p>It was a deal with the devil, made in a moment of desperation, and it’s been haunting Google ever since.</p>\n</blockquote>",frontmatter:{title:"Google's lame excuse for not offering LTE on Nexus 4",date:"October 31, 2012",passthroughUrl:"http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/10/29/googles-lame-duck-explanation-of-why-the-nexus-4-doesnt-have-lte/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/2012/10/googles-lame-excuse-for-not-offering-lte-on-nexus-4/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2012/10/why-im-returning-my-surface/"},frontmatter:{title:"Why I’m returning my Surface",passthroughUrl:"http://ozar.me/2012/10/why-im-returning-my-microsoft-surface-rt/"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2012/11/cook-is-the-head-ive-is-the-heart-schiller-is-the-voice/"},frontmatter:{title:"Cook is the head, Ive is the heart, Schiller is the voice",passthroughUrl:"http://more-real.com/blog/2012/10/31/the-all-new-apple-the-head-the-heart-and-the-voice"}}}}}});
