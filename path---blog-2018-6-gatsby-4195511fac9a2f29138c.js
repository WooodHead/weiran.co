And after taking inspiration from my friend <a href="https://eddielee.me/hello-gatsby">Eddie moving his blog to Gatsby</a>, I decided — under the pretence of saving money — to migrate my website to Gatsby as well. </p>\n<h2>Gatsby</h2>\n<p><a href="Gatsby">Gatsby</a> is a static site generator for React. You design and build your web site locally, including all the content in Markdown, and the build process produces a pre-built static website that can be hosted (in my case, for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>).</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog">Gatsby Starter Blog template project</a> is an excellent way to learn about Gatsby, and you may be able to tell this website is heavily based on it.</p>\n<h2>The Migration</h2>\n<p>Gatsby content is defined by Markdown files on the filesystem. Squarespace exports your content into a <a href="https://devtidbits.com/2011/03/16/the-wordpress-extended-rss-wxr-exportimport-xml-document-format-decoded-and-explained/">WordPress export format</a> file. But even if you used Markdown content blocks in Squarespace, the export will only give you content as HTML. Damn.</p>\n<p>So how do I convert Squarespace’s export into something I can use with Gatsby?</p>\n<h2>WordPress to Gatsby Migrator</h2>\n<p>An old saying goes: “there’s an NPM package for everything”. In this case <a href="https://github.com/domchristie/turndown">Turndown</a> for converting HTML into Markdown, is exactly what was needed. Sprinkle a few more packages to help parse the RSS format export, string them all together, and out came my new tool <a href="https://github.com/weiran/wordpress-gatsby-migrater">wordpress-gatsby-migrater</a>.</p>\n<p>Modern programming 101: why reinvent the wheel when someone smarter than you has already reinveted it.</p>\n<p>After running it, with only a few tweaks to the starter project and the new website is finished.</p>\n<p>Was it all worth it? If I converted the number of hours I spent on this and how much Squarespace costs per month, it would probably have paid for years of Squarespace service. </p>\n<p>But doing this was easily way more fun, and it may even get me blogging more.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Moving from Squarespace to Gatsby",date:"June 02, 2018",passthroughUrl:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/2018/6/gatsby/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/blog/watch-it-later-announcement/"},frontmatter:{title:"Watch It Later for Apple TV",passthroughUrl:null,type:null}},next:null}}}});
