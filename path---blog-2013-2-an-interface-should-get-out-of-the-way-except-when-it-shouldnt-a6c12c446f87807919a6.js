It’s about making the right choices about what should be there, and what shouldn’t. There is nothing wrong with making the things that are in the product visible, sometimes very much so. Let’s not forget that one Rams’s other principles is that “Good design is aesthetic”.</p>\n</blockquote>",frontmatter:{title:"An interface should get out of the way, except when it shouldn’t",date:"February 08, 2013",passthroughUrl:"http://www.elezea.com/2013/02/as-little-design-as-possible/"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/2013/2/an-interface-should-get-out-of-the-way-except-when-it-shouldnt/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/2/shops-deny-claims-by-thorsten-heins-that-blackberry-phones-are-selling-out/"},frontmatter:{title:"Shops deny claims by Thorsten Heins that BlackBerry phones are selling out",passthroughUrl:"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/9853190/BlackBerry-10-shops-deny-claims-by-Thorsten-Heins-that-Z10-phones-are-selling-out.html"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/blog/2013/2/surface-pro-sells-out/"},frontmatter:{title:'Surface Pro "sells out"',passthroughUrl:"http://virtualpants.com/post/42690590612/surface-pro-sells-out"}}}}}});
