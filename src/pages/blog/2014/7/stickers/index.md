I like this new advert.

It's another peek of Apple's transition into a post-Steve era. You can almost hear the cries of "Steve would never have let stickers interfere with the Apple logo", but Apple isn't about minimalism for the sake of it. Apple has always tried to create products that fit into it's customer's lives, and this advert exemplifies that.

Steve Jobs left behind a company that doesn't just stick with the same ideas and the same aesthetic; a company that doesn't settle for the comfort of it's previous success. Think Different wasn't just for the world to see Apple, but for Apple itself.
