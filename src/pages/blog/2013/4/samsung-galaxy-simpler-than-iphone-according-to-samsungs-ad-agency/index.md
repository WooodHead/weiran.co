Similar to last month's BBC [gaff](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/21/bbc-samsung-journamalism), CNN reports that Siegel+Gale found in a 'survey' that Samsung Galaxy phones are simplier than iPhones.

After some [exhaustive research](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Siegel%2BGale+clients+samsung), I was able to determin that Samsung is actually a client of Siegle+Gale.

Pretty sloppy.
