> The most interesting plan here is to use .search to operate a redirect service on the “on the ‘dotless’ .search domain (http://search/) that, combined with a simple technical standard, will allow a consistent query interface across firms that provide search functionality, and will enable users to easily conduct searches with firms that provide the search functionality that they designate as their preference.”

So the biggest search engine would control the new 'search' domain, other search engines would have to beg them for access, and they would be privvy to every search performed through that top level domain.

Sounds great.
