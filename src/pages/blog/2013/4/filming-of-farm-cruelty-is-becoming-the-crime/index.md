The New York Times:

> One of the group’s model bills, “[The Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act](http://alecexposed.org/w/images/f/f5/7K13-The_Animal_and_Ecological_Terrorism_Act_%28AETA%29_Exposed.pdf),” prohibits filming or taking pictures on livestock farms to “defame the facility or its owner.” Violators would be placed on a “terrorist registry.”

In the land of the free, you can't record interactions with the police, you can't publish leaked information if it embaresses the government, and you're branded a terrorist if you try to expose animal cruelty.
