> We launched the WebM Project in May 2010 with the goal of providing the web with a high-quality, open, royalty-free video codec that anyone can use, and that can inspire future innovators. Today's announcement is an important step toward that goal.

So VP8 wasn't as patent unencumbered as Googled claimed back in 2010. It took nearly three years for Google to license those patents, no doubt a difficult task but hopefully one that creates a future for VP8.
