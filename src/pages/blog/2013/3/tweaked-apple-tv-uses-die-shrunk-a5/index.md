The revised Apple TV isn't using the [quad-GPU A5X chip](http://weiranzhang.com/blog/2013/1/new-apple-tv-with-a5x-revealed-in-fcc-documents) that was speculated in January. However the new revised A5 is smaller than the old chip, which means Apple is again using the A5 as the testbed for a new process.
