The reliable Rene Ritchie from iMore has a source which claims that Apple has considered launching the next generation of iPads in April, and the iPhone 5S in August.

I'm doubtful that a iPad mini with Retina display can be released so soon, but what other feature could Apple give the mini to differentiate the second generation? Just an A6 processor isn't enough.
