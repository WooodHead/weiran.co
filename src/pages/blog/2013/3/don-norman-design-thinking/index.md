> In June, 2010, I posted an essay on Core77 entitled "[Design Thinking: A Useful Myth](http://www.core77.com/blog/columns/design_thinking_a_useful_myth_16790.asp)." Since my essay was posted, I keep encountering people who jump to solutions and who fail to question assumptionsâ€”engineers, business people, and yes, designers (and design students). These encounters made me reconsider. I observed design students who were acting mindlessly, simply doing their assignments as presented. No creativity, no imagination, no questioning. That's not what design thinking is about. As a result, I have changed my mind: Design Thinking really is special.

When Don Norman talks about design, you listen.
