Just when you though Yahoo might be getting back on their game by appointing Marissa Meyer as their CEO and rejuvenating Flickr, they spend a rumoured Â£20 million on a startup with very little in the way of innovative technology or traction.

But why? Because of the founder Nick D'Aloisio. Since the aquisition, Big Media has focused so much on his age that I've yet to read an article about anything else. He is featured on newspapers and TV channels across the world as a 21st century success story, with Yahoo in the background as the protective parent. Getting Yahoo back into mainstream news in such a big way must be worth the investment alone. In other words, it's an [acqhire](http://www.techopedia.com/definition/28595/acqhire) not in the traditional sense for talent, but for publicity.
