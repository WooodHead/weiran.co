From the people that made [Snapseed](http://www.snapseed.com), a collection of Photoshop, Lightroom, and Aperture plugins designed for photo editing.

$149 is a great price for what's included, but how long will Google stick with selling software like this? It's not their business model and they've shown it takes very little for them to abandon an unsuccessful product.
