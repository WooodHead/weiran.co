I'm not entirely sure what to make of this, but Rubin's replacement Sundar Pichai has proven himself with the Chrome browser and it will be interesting to see how his approach wil differ from Rubin's.

> But his insight immediately struck a chord because at the time it was extremely painful developing services for mobile devices. We had a closet full of more than 100 phones and were building our software pretty much device by device. It was nearly impossible for us to make truly great mobile experiences.

That's pretty ironic given how difficult it is to develop an app that suits every Android device in the wild.
