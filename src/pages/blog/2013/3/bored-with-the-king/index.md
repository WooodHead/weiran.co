Apple, now the big player, has to take the hits that big players get:

> But that’s how news reporters increasingly are treating the state of the industry. The desire for the “Oh, how the mighty Apple has fallen” narrative is so strong that the narrative is simply being stated as fact, evidence to the contrary be damned. It’s reported as true simply because they want it to be true. They’re declaring “The King is dead; long live the King” not because the king has actually died or abdicated the throne, but because they’re bored with the king and want to write a new coronation story.

Compared with [Apple's real problems](http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/305), this is just an interesting but annoying distraction.
