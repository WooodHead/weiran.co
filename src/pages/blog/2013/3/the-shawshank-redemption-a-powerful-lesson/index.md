> The simple but powerful message is this: ‘Enjoy The Journey’. Remember the smile on Andy’s face when he disposes off the pieces from the wall every day in that prison ground? It could be the light at the end of the tunnel that keeps you going, or it could be the thrill that comes from the stealthiness of it all – but you have to remember that the journey is more important and satisfying than the end destination – getting into that mode is absolutely essential for everyone embarking on the journey.

> You have no idea how deep the wall is. You have nothing but a rock hammer. You have no idea when you will be caught. But what you do have, is the journey. Enjoy the journey.
