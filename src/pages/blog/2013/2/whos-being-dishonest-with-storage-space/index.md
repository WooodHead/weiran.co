Good reporting from Ed Bott, when comparing the Surface Pro to a MacBook Air the amount of free space is about the same. The problem is that people will naturally compare the Surface Pro with an iPad.

Thought what Bott fails to mention is you can delete the recovery partition on a MacBook Air and still use [Internet Recovery](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718) to restore OS X. On the Surface Pro, if you want to recover the space used by the recovery partition you have to create an external USB recovery drive that you'll almost certainly lose.
