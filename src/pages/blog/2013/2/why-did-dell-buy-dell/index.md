As a founder whose name adorns the shingle outside the door, Dell is playing a high stakes poker to literally save his good name. Just the idea that some faceless Asian company would own “Dell” the brand and his name is anathema.

Michael Dell is going all-in, good luck to him. Hopefully he'll come with something more than just a commodity PC manufacturer at the other side.
