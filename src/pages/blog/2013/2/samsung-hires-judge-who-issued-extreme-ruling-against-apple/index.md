FOSS Patents does some sleuthing and discoveres the judge that ordered Apple to publish an [apology](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19989750) to Samsung, and [then rewrite](http://allthingsd.com/20121101/u-k-court-orders-apple-to-make-its-samsung-apology-more-apologetic/) that apology, is being paid by Samsung as a patent consultant:

> That said, this just doesn't feel right. It gives the impression that a judge who deals Samsung's number one rival a huge PR blow, in a way that I found very extreme and unjustified, will be generously rewarded. For that reason alone, I think both Samsung and Sir Robin Jacob should not have done this.

I guess Samsung liked what they saw.
