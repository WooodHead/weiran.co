Matt Drance on Sony's strange Playstation 4 announcement:

> People would have happily waited longer for a comprehensive, exciting product launch. It’s been nearly seven years since the last PlayStation was revealed; would another month or two have tipped some scale? Whoever this was aimed at — developers, hardcore gamers, casual gamers — the utter lack of usable information makes the timing questionable at best.

Sony has a history of botched product announcements, and it seems they haven't learned anything.
