Movist has long been one of my favourite video players for the Mac. The simplicity of it's interface and it's speed has kept me from using [VLC](http://www.videolan.org) or [MPlayerX](http://mplayerx.org). I simply perfer the way Movist 'feels'.

The original Movist project is hosted on Google Code, unfortunately there hasn't been any activity since April 2010. But being open source, Nur Monson has [forked the project onto GitHub](https://github.com/samiamwork/Movist/) and resolved the many problems with getting it to build with the latest Xcode and made it a 'modern' OS X application, removing reliance on depreciated APIs.

Hopefully now that Nur has given the project a solid foundation again, it will once again flourish as an active open source project with an engaged community.

If you want to try it out, I've built the latest version [which you can download here](/s/Movist.zip).
