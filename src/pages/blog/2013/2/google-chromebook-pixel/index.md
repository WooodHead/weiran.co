A highly impressive notebook from Google, I love the industrial design and of course the 2560x1700 resolution display. It has an aspect ratio of 3:2 which is unique, it will be interesting to see why they chose it and if Chrome OS will take advantage of it.

This is what Google can do when they integrate software and hardware, imagine the phones they could produce if they did this with Android. Maybe this is an experiment that will influence their future decisions.

No mention of who they partnered with for the hardware, I would guess Samsung.
