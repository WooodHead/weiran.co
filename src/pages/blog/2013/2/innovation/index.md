'iHKDesign' responds to an idiotic article on CNN claiming that Samsung is 'out innovating Apple':

> It seems to me that today, innovation means a feature that Apple decided not to implement. This is a very stupid way of thinking. All the things that Kovach listed in his articles were features with caveats. Innovation is redefining an entire product category, something Apple has done at least five times (Macintosh, iPod, iTunes Music Store, iPhone, and iPad). Innovation can’t be bought, it can’t be created through ads, and innovation is not just merely strapping on features to an OS. That is laziness. And writing an article like the one he did is just plain old bullshit.
