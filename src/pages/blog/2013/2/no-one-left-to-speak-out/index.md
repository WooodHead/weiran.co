The UK High Court has [ordered UK ISPs to block more torrent sites](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21601609) at the whim of the BPI, a private company representing the interests of music labels, despite data showing that blocking these sites have little effect on copyright infringement.

This slippery slope started with [court ordered blocking of child porn](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4377348.stm) sites. Then they decided to block [violent porn sites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom#.22Extreme.22_pornography), and then terrorist sites. What's next?

I'm reminded of a [poem by Martin Niemöller](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Niemöller):

> When the Nazis came for the communists, I remained silent; I was not a communist.
> 
> When they locked up the social democrats, I remained silent; I was not a social democrat.
> 
> When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out; I was not a trade unionist.
> 
> When they came for the Jews, I remained silent; I wasn't a Jew.
> 
> When they came for me, there was no one left to speak out.
