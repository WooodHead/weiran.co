> In an interview this week, Mr Heins hailed the success of his company’s new phones, saying that sales in the UK were “beyond expectations”. Talking about the Z10 - one of two new BlackBerry handsets unveiled last week - he added: “White is sold out already. The black is hard to stock up again. It’s very encouraging.”

> Staff at Phones 4U, the exclusive UK supplier of the white Z10, said that they have not sold out of the handsets. When the website Mobile News contacted the retailer’s customer services and two of its retail stores, all of them said the white handset was still in stock.

Maybe he's confusing sold with shipped again.
