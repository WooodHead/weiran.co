An Apple spokesman told TNW that the new Apple TV model is just a in-season silent upgrade:

> “We sometimes make component changes which require an updated model number for regulatory approval,” an Apple spokesperson told TNW. “The component changes we made don’t affect product features and Apple TV customers will continue to have the same great user experience.”

[Like Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2013/01/31/appletv-a5xr2), I now believe this new Apple TV is a test bed for production of a die-shrunk A5X SoC called the A5XR2, in the same way it was originally used to test the die shrunk A5.

Chances of a Retina iPad mini appearing this year seem to be improving.
