Today we found out that CNET writers don't have the independence from their parent company CBS after they banned them from letting Dish's Hopper DVR participate in their best of CES awards.

CES Corp. is suing Dish over the advertising skip feature in their DVR, and it's clear they're imposing their own agenda on their publications.

It should be noted that CBS also owns TechRepublic and ZDNet.
