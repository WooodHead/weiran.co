Tapbots, makers of Tweetbot, has made it's App.net app [Netbot](http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/) free to encourage App.net adoption.

For developers of other paid App.net apps things may not [seem that rosy](https://alpha.app.net/jaminguy/post/2711149), but along with the new [File API](http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/) announced this week, App.net is making a big push for more adoption, which in the long term is good for everyone.
