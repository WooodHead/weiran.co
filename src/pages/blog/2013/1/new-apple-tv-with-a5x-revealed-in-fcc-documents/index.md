Brian Klug from Anandtech has discovered that a reference to an as yet unreleased Apple TV 3,2 found in the latest iOS 6 firmware suggests that this new version of the Apple TV will contain the A5X chip from the iPad 3rd generation.

If true, the only reason I can think why Apple put such a powerfup system on a chip into an Apple TV is gaming.

It's worth noting that current Apple TV's have a binned A5 SOC, with one of the CPU cores disabled.
