I wouldn't normally link to a [link-bait article such as this](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/apples-brilliant-boondoggle-macbook-pro-retina-display.php), but the comment from another staff writer at ReadWriteWeb is quite revealing:

Marco Arment has [debunked the rest of the post](http://www.marco.org/2012/07/14/rww-retina-clickbait).
