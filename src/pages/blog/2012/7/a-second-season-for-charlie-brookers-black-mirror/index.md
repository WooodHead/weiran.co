Channel 4 is [bringing back Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror](http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/07/12/15757/another_look_in_the_black_mirror) for a second series of three episodes: 

> The first series prompted 322 complaints over a story in which a Prime Minister was blackmailed into having sex with a pig live on TV.  
>   
> Brooker said: ‘Half of the things in the first run of Black Mirror seem to be on the verge of coming true. They've got prisoners in Brazilian prisons pedalling on exercise bikes to reduce their sentences (not entirely dissimilar to the episode 15 Million Merits) and Google Glass looks like copyright infringement as far as The Entire History of You is concerned.  
>   
> 'If the stories from the second run start coming true then we're REALLY in trouble.'
