More from the [Tapbots blog](http://tapbots.com/blog/tweetbot/tweetbot-for-mac):

> “We’ve decided to release it as a public alpha to a) motivate us to finish faster, and b) get feedback to help us build the best Mac incarnation of Tweetbot we can make.”

One has to wonder if this is a preemptive move by Tapbots to gather public support against [Twitter's attack on client apps](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience).
