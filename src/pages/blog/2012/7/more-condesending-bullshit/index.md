I can't believe ReadWriteWeb let Antone Gonsalves write [a follow-up post](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yes-macbook-pros-retina-display-is-brilliant-but-not-for-the-average-user.php) to [his piece on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display](http://www.weiranzhang.com/2012/7/readwriteweb-on-the-macbook-pro-retina-display).

And of course, the top comment is from fellow writer Jon Mitchell:

> Again, I wish I didn't have to do this, but the "we" Antone mentions at the top of this post does not include me. I don't stand behind any of this stuff regarding the Retina MBP, personally.
