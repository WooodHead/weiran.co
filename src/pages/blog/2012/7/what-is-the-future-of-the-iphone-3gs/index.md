[Matthew Panzarino speculates that Apple will drop the iPhone 4 rather than the iPhone 3GS](http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/07/18/what-is-the-future-of-the-iphone-3gs/) when "the new iPhone" is released later this year. This would open the pay-as-you-go market to the iPhone, which has eluded it so far.

It certainly makes sense in a lot of ways, why would Apple bother to shoe-horn iOS 6 into the 3GS if they're going to stop selling it?
