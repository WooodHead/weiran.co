It seems BetaWorks isÂ [buying Digg for their technology](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304373804577523181002565776.html), and not so much the brand.

That is the price for being the loser.

**Update**: it seems the Wall Street Journal didn't get the full story, as [TechCrunch reports](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/12/digg-sold-to-linkedin-and-the-washington-post-and-betaworks/) the Washington Post paid $12 million for Digg's team, and LinkedIn paid $4 million for it's patents.
