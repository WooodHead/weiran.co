> It seems like Google is adding stuff to Chrome just to add it. It’s as if they feel like they can’t do nothing feature-wise, so they come up with junk to shove in there, slowing Chrome down in the process.

This is the reason why I use Safari over Chrome on my Mac. It's still the best browser on Windows.
