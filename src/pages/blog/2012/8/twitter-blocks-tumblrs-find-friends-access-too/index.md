Marco Arment on Twitter's blocking of Tumblr "find friends" access

> Twitter will now only permit large services to add value to Twitter, not get any value from it.   
>   
> So when Twitter says something like “\[developers\] will need to work with us” to “identify areas of value” when they get big enough for Twitter to notice, I don’t have high hopes for what “working with us” might actually entail. 

Twitter clearly see themselves in a strong enough position to be safe from being disrupted. It's certainly hard to argue against it.
