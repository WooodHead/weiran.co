> This is a sentiment you often hear from people: casual users only need entry-level devices. Even casual users themselves perpetuate it: "Oh, I’m not doing much on my computer, so I always just go with the cheapest option". And then they buy a horrid, underpowered netbook, find out that it has a tiny screen, is incredibly slow, the keyboard sucks, and they either never actually use it, or eventually come to the conclusion that they just hate computers.

> In reality, it’s exactly backwards: proficient users can deal with a crappy computer, but casual users need as good a computer as possible.
