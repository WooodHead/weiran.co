Don Lehman analyses the ramifications of Apple's recent management changes:

> Cook's task of molding the executive team to work best for him is set for the next 5-10 years. Instead of individuals running product teams, he now has them geared towards discipline teams. This allows the executive team to function with the flexibility of a small startup. They are responsible for coming up with Apple's strategy and product, and each member is amplified by the strength of the team that reports to them. It should be pretty exciting to see how this plays out.
