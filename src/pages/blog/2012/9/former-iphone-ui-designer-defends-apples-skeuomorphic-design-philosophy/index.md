> The thing to remember is that UI design is like selling a restaurant, where you canâ€™t just serve up good food in order to run a restaurant. You have to create an environment around the food that gets people in the mood to enjoy a really great meal: presenting the food really nicely, picking the right plates, the lighting on the table, the music that is playing. When you put it all that together, it creates a much nicer experience than if you just were to serve up some good food.
