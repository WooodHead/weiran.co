Anand has found that recent builds of Webkit nightly have drastically better scrolling performance than Safari 6.0.2.

It's not just Retina MacBook Pros that have problems with scrolling performance in Safari. The Mac mini I use at work struggles when zoomed in on a complex website like The Verge. The nightly builds are much faster as well.

Get the nightly builds from [webkit.org](http://nightly.webkit.org).
