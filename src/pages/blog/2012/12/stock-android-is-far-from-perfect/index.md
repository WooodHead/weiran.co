The worst UI "feature" in Android is it's back button. It feels like a superfluous addition from the days when Android was more like Blackberry. iOS lets apps display their own back button in their UI, and results in a much less confusing experience for the user. The problem is, can Android handle the removal of all the permanent buttons, especially the back and menu button, when so many apps depend on them?
