Google demonstration how to discontinue a free service while sugarcoating the announcement.

My family use Google Apps hosting for all our email, and while I have no problems with paying the $50 per year cost personally, I'm not sure the rest of my family would.

I wonder how long it will be until exisiting free users will have to start paying. I've already begun looking into alternatives like [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.fm) and Outlook.com domain hosting.
