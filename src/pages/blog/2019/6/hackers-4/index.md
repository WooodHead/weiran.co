I just shipped biggest updates to [Hackers](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hackers-hacker-news-reading/id603503901?at=11l4G8&ct=weiran.co) since 2017: 4.0. A lot of changes come with this new versions, some highlights include: 

* You can now login to your Hacker News account in the app
* That means **swipe right** to up vote posts and comments
* And **swipe left** to collapse a whole comment thread

I put in a big effort in the past couple months to tidy up the code base ready for iOS 13. If you didn't know, [Hackers is an open source project](https://github.com/weiran/Hackers). You can see all the Issues and Pull Requests that went into this update in the [4.0 Milestone](https://github.com/weiran/Hackers/milestone/5?closed=1), and if you want to get your hands dirty, there are [a few easy to pick up features in the list](https://github.com/weiran/Hackers/issues).

Hackers has reached an interesting place; it has been the top result when you search for "Hacker News" on the App Store for a while. It's the most popular it's ever been, even though there are dozens of competing apps. I think one of the reasons Hackers has risen to the top of the pile is my persistance since 2013. There was a period between 2014-15 that I experimented with paid pricing, ranging from 99p to Â£2.99, and there was a small chance than it could make me a small amount of recurring revenue. But I was never really happy with charging people to use a pet project, and I had wasn't deluded enough to think that an iOS Hacker News app could do any more than fill a niche.

Since 2016 I've tried to update it regularly, adding support for new iOS versions, iPad support, making each interaction with the app slicker with every release. It's also a exercise book for my own programming skills, something I use to keep my tools sharpened. 

I want to thank the people who've taken the time to contribute to the app, and also to all the users who left a review or sent me a kind message. It's really appreciated.

Here's to the next six years.
