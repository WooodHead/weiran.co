I had some time off over Christmas, so I decided to scratch an itch I’ve had for a while now.

[Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) has been my go to place to save articles and videos from the web. However only way to watch them on the Apple TV is to accept the dubious experience of using AirPlay. Half the time the video would stop when my iPhone locked, and the other half of the time I had to hold my iPhone and tap the screen every few seconds to keep it awake.

I dabbled with the Instapaper API [in the past](https://github.com/weiran/Metropaper), and had the classical programmer thought process of “how hard can it be”.

So I built [Watch It Later](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watch-it-later/id1191095941?ls=1&mt=8&at=11l4G8&ct=weiran.co) in a day, an Apple TV app that lets you play your saved Instapaper videos. It supports YouTube and Vimeo, and can playback with the native Apple TV video player.

I also [open sourced it on GitHub](https://github.com/weiran/watch-it-later) , because at this point, why not? And you can [download it for free on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watch-it-later/id1191095941?ls=1&mt=8&at=11l4G8&ct=weiran.co).

If you use it, I’d love to hear your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/weiran) or [GitHub](https://github.com/weiran/watch-it-later).
