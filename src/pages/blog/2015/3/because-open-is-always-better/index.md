Google are doing some questionable things with new TLDs, and the Internet is letting them get away with it:

> My point is that if you think Google is some kind of Patron Saint of the Open Web, shit son. Tim Cook on his best day could not conceive of a dastardly plan like this. This is a methodical, coordinated, long-running and well-planned attack on the open web that comes from the highest levels of Google leadership. And weâ€™re giving Apple a free pass? Pshaw.

Because we all want .blog TLD to be used exclusively buy the hot internet startup called Blogger right?
