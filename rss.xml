&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instapaper.com&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; has been my go to place to save articles and videos from the web. However only way to watch them on the Apple TV is to accept the dubious experience of using AirPlay. Half the time the video would stop when my iPhone locked, and the other half of the time I had to hold my iPhone and tap the screen every few seconds to keep it awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dabbled with the Instapaper API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/weiran/Metropaper&quot;&gt;in the past&lt;/a&gt;, and had the classical programmer thought process of “how hard can it be”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I built &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watch-it-later/id1191095941?ls=1&amp;#x26;mt=8&amp;#x26;at=11l4G8&amp;#x26;ct=weiran.co&quot;&gt;Watch It Later&lt;/a&gt; in a day, an Apple TV app that lets you play your saved Instapaper videos. It supports YouTube and Vimeo, and can playback with the native Apple TV video player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/weiran/watch-it-later&quot;&gt;open sourced it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; , because at this point, why not? And you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watch-it-later/id1191095941?ls=1&amp;#x26;mt=8&amp;#x26;at=11l4G8&amp;#x26;ct=weiran.co&quot;&gt;download it for free on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use it, I’d love to hear your feedback on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/weiran&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/weiran/watch-it-later&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Speculation about the next GPU in the iMac]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tomorrow is Apple’s big iPhone event day, with a dash of Apple Watch and software thrown in.

However &lt;a href=&quot;gurman-mac&quot;&gt;Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; reports no new Macs at this event, so in lieu of real products announcements I thought I’d add some speculation about the new iMac GPUs now that AMD has released their brand new Radeon chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iMacs have used mobile graphics cards (GPUs) since 2011, when desktop GPUs started to get too hot for the iMac to cool. Apple flippled flopped between AMD and Nvidia as their supplier, before finally settling down with AMD for the retina iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD make fine graphics cards, but in recent years Nvidia had the edge in terms of performance, heat, and power usage. The current top of the range AMD graphics card in the iMac, the Radeon R9 M395X, just doesn’t compare well to Nvidia’s 970M, even though on the spec sheet the AMD card should be faster. But in comparison the AMD card is slower, more power hungry, and thermally throttles when pushed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMD Polaris&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD’s long term solution was a &lt;a href=&quot;amd-polaris&quot;&gt;major overhaul&lt;/a&gt; of their archectecture called Polaris, to improve what they call Performance per Watt. With the release of the desktop AMD RX480 and RX470, there’s no doubt that AMD have made up a lot of ground on Nvidia, yet a noticable gap still exists when you compare the latest generation of both companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t likely to deter Apple in choosing AMD as their GPU supplier again though, as the preferential pricing from AMD sweetens and sourness from not having the best avalilable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the potential of custom APUs with the release of Zen next year, with a big CPU and GPU packaged into one chip like the Xbox One and PS4, but that’s another topic entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What will Apple pick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem for Apple, is the new mobile Polaris GPUs aren’t very fast. The mobile version of the RX480 is based on a cut down chip with half of almost everything, making it much slower than the outgoing R9 M395X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple will need to use the desktop AMD GPUs again to even maintain performance with the previous generation, let alone improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is the first time in a while where they can use desktop AMD GPUs. The RX470 is rated at 120W &lt;a href=&quot;tdp&quot;&gt;TDP&lt;/a&gt;, which compares with the current M395X’s 125W TDP. If Apple can put a RX470 into the iMac, that will offer a 50% performance increase over the M395X for roughly the same power usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Apple use a RX470? I hope so, although they can get away with a slower RX460 and still improve over the previous generation, the iMac can handle the RX470 and it would be a shame if it wasn’t an option at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base GPU would then be the RX480M, which is comparable to the outgoing M380, and I’d imagine the RX460 or similar as the mid range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does pose a problem with branding, with the RX460 and RX470 being much faster than the bottom of the range RX480M. So like the Mac Pro I expect AMD to allow Apple to have their own model names, perhaps W460, W470, and W480:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good: AMD RX480M 2GB (W460)&lt;br&gt;
Better: AMD RX460 4GB (W470)&lt;br&gt;
Best: AMD RX470 8GB (W480)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Travelling Light with iOS]]></title><description><![CDATA[It wasn’t long ago that travelling on a trip longer than two weeks meant lumbering a laptop with you the whole way.

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long ago that travelling on a trip longer than two weeks meant lumbering a laptop with you the whole way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just recently returned from a four week trip travelling 5000 kilometres across the north of China, from Xi’an, through the dry rocky deserts, and finishing in Kashgar in western China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I had was my iPhone and iPad (with a keyboard). Obviously I didn’t write any software but I could do pretty much everything else. If you can, travelling light can make a big impact on your daily stress level. Here are a few tips and tricks I learned while on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cellular data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to underestimate how useful having good cellular data coverage is. With it, you can practically never get lost, and be your own tour guide at the same time by using apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/inquire-by-tamper/id1045268097?mt=8&quot;&gt;Inquire&lt;/a&gt;, which shows you Wikipedia articles about places close to your current location. I love the liberating feeling of just going where the path takes me instead of meticulously following a plan, and having cellular data gives me the confidence to just follow my feet and figure out where I am later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to buy SIM cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best source of information about buying SIM cards internationally is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikivoyage.org&quot;&gt;WikiVoyage&lt;/a&gt;. Each country’s page on WikiVoyage will have a section discussing the cheapest and easiest ways to get a data SIM. You could also use a carrier like Three UK which gives free data roaming to several countries. You just need a little bit of pre-planning to make sure you get the right SIM, with the right coverage, when you land.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with the Great Firewall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re travelling in China like I am, you’ll find lots of the usual websites and services blocked or heavily throttled by the Great Firewall. Services such as Google, Dropbox, Twitter are all unusable over cellular or a WiFi connection. To get around this you’ll need a VPN able to punch a hole through the firewall, without being caught by the sophisticated deep packet analysis that blocks the majority of VPN services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressvpn.xyz/&quot;&gt;ExpressVPN&lt;/a&gt; to be reliable and easy to use on iOS, it bills every 30 days and uses a combination of UDP, TCP, and IPSec transports to get around present and future firewall restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had time, I would’ve setup &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jlund/streisand&quot;&gt;Streisand&lt;/a&gt; on a VM at DigitalOcean instead, but ExpressVPN worked well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem is that using a constantly running VPN really hurts battery life, I probably got around half what I would normally expect to get, even with the excellent 4G reception in China. See the section below on charging and battery life to see ways to mitigate this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your phone or watch holds key information like your boarding pass, keeping all your devices charged up is more important than ever. I use an iPhone 6s, not a phone known for it’s long battery life. Day-to-day I never usually worry about the battery running out, but when I’m travelling a typical day is often a lot longer, and a lot more strenuous on the phone’s battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simpliest solution if you just have a phone is to buy a charging case, I would get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1Yz2PXg&quot;&gt;Apple Smart Battery Case&lt;/a&gt;. It’s integration with iOS, a design that avoids blocking antennas that would give attenuation, and the standard Lightning port for charging, make it the best overall case if you own an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like a lot of people, I have an increasing number of devices to keep charged, such as my Apple Watch, iPad, Bluetooth headphones, and my partner’s phone and iPad as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I use an external battery, and my preference goes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1UgKIjZ&quot;&gt;Xiaomi’s 10000mAh Power Bank&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be honest, I like it best because its design reminds of of an oversized iPod mini, a nice aluminium shell with chamfered edges and four sexy LEDs indicating battery life. It’s also one of the smallest batteries for its capacity. Paired with a short lightning and micro USB cables, it can easily keep every device I own charged up for at least two days without access to mains power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mains power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For charging in hotels, I use an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1sMEyRP&quot;&gt;Anker 5 port USB charger&lt;/a&gt;, capable of outputting 60W so I can charge two iPhones, two iPads, and the Xiaomi external battery all at full speed. Unfortunately my old Panasonic GF-1 camera can’t be charged via USB, so that has it’s own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this fits neatly into an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1sMES2X&quot;&gt;Ecosusi bag&lt;/a&gt;, making it easy to pack away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with the recommendation from The Wirecutter for best carry-on luggage, going with the middle of the road &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1OwPHQE&quot;&gt;Travelpro Crew 10 suitcase&lt;/a&gt;. The quality of the materials, handle, and design all make it worth that extra over cheaper alternatives. This is not a suitcase you worry about breaking open, I even checked it in as hold luggage twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t already, you should really use some &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1UgK6ed&quot;&gt;packing cubes&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you’re going on a trip with a lot of different destinations so you don’t want to unpack and repack at everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, because I like to travel light I don’t feel the need for a backpack, so my day to day bag is the handsome &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1sMHfTl&quot;&gt;Billingham Hadley Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a shoulder bag designed for cameras but equally useful when travelling. I like the proper latch, which prevents oppurtunistic theives, but also has a quick release mechanism for easy access. I like the new Fibernyte material, which is like canvas but completely waterproof and requires no maintenence. The pockets inside and outside are plenty for a bag this size, and the padding means you can store cameras, iPhones, and iPads without worry. I would also recommend a &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1ScaCmS&quot;&gt;shoulder pad&lt;/a&gt; as the strap is quite slippery, and to give a bit more comfort after carrying that for a long day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling with a partner? On really long trips I like to listen to audiobooks, and if you want to listen together a cheap &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1Ui67yE&quot;&gt;headphone splitter&lt;/a&gt; is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing a lot of walking? A decent pair of shoes is essential, I did a fair amount of research before getting a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/28OnnQt&quot;&gt;Salomon Evasion&lt;/a&gt; walking shoes, and they’re the best walking shoes I’ve ever bought. I walked 30km in a single day with these shoes without a blister.&lt;/p&gt;

Circle Test]]></title><description><![CDATA[Every year I tell myself I don’t do New Years Resolutions, they have a tendency to set one up for failure or have goals that are so benign…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/1-circle-test/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/1-circle-test/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2016 09:18:33 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Every year I tell myself I don’t do New Years Resolutions, they have a tendency to set one up for failure or have goals that are so benign you wonder why you had to wait for new years to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every year I find myself succumbing to a feeling I get only on January 1st, the feeling to try something new and make this new year different from the last one. I suppose it’s a natural human reaction when you reach the age of 30, a kind of annual mini-mid-life-crisis where I look back at the previous year and wonder what the fuck did I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for this year, in an effort to do something with my life, I will try to release something I’ve made every month for 12 months. Now I know what you’re thinking, this either sounds like bullshit or I’m just going to draw a cuddly cartoon animal every month and look smug for the other 29 days. But I want to challenge myself while at the same time doing something I can finish in 30 days, so I’m going to make a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Circle Test&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first unimaginatively named game is Circle Test. This started out as an idea for a tvOS game before I realised that almost no one I know has an Apple TV that can run it. The first challenge probably should be something I can get some feedback on otherwise I’m just making crap for myself here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is simple, see how good your hand to eye coordination is by mashing your iOS device when the red semicircle is colliding with the purple semicircle. Through some non-scientific testing I did which has yielded statistically irrelevant data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an average person after a night out and a few drinks can get around &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone with the ability to really concentrate for more than 10 seconds at a time can get around &lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a seasoned Counter Strike: Global Offensive player while wearing some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gunnars.com&quot;&gt;cool gaming glasses&lt;/a&gt; should get over &lt;strong&gt;35&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target area gets generally smaller and the speed faster as your score goes up. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you were wondering how I’m going to release a new game or app every month, the answer is by keeping the scope small but with wiggle room to &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/V7UzuWZ.jpg&quot;&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;. I can be sure that at the end of every month I will have that smug look someone has when they’ve shipped something on my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that if you think Google is some kind of Patron Saint of the Open Web, shit son. Tim Cook on his best day could not conceive of a dastardly plan like this. This is a methodical, coordinated, long-running and well-planned attack on the open web that comes from the highest levels of Google leadership. And we’re giving Apple a free pass? Pshaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we all want .blog TLD to be used exclusively buy the hot internet startup called Blogger right?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stickers]]></title><description><![CDATA[I like this new advert.

&lt;p&gt;It’s another peek of Apple’s transition into a post-Steve era. You can almost hear the cries of “Steve would never have let stickers interfere with the Apple logo”, but Apple isn’t about minimalism for the sake of it. Apple has always tried to create products that fit into it’s customer’s lives, and this advert exemplifies that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs left behind a company that doesn’t just stick with the same ideas and the same aesthetic; a company that doesn’t settle for the comfort of it’s previous success. Think Different wasn’t just for the world to see Apple, but for Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pinboard turns five years old]]></title><description><![CDATA[I find that the longer I run the site, the more resistant I become to the idea of ever giving it up, even if I need to take the occasional…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2014/7/pinboard-turns-five-years-old/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2014/7/pinboard-turns-five-years-old/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2014 14:23:19 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that the longer I run the site, the more resistant I become to the idea of ever giving it up, even if I need to take the occasional break. It is pleasant to work on something that people draw benefit from. It is especially pleasant to work on something lasting. And I enjoy the looking-glass aspect of our industry, where running a mildly profitable small business makes me a crazy maverick not afraid to break all the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinboard is the outlier, it bucks the trend, or maybe its the trend setter. I know I’ve been a very happy customer for over four years.&lt;/p&gt;

I know Apple is probably buying Beats for their music streaming rather than their hardware, but one doesn’t come with the other and the most iconic product of Beats are their headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A glance at your Twitter feed today and you would’ve seen endless comments comparing Beats customers to uninformed sheep willing to make Dr Dre rich by buying his ridiculously oversized yet mediocre sounding headphones. After that, theres the inevitable link to some headphones half the price and twice as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To an extent I agree with them, Beats headphones are overpriced, but I’m not sure anyone buying a pair is under the impression they’re getting a bargain, or even that they’re getting the best headphones for their money. They’re buying Beats headphones because they want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Jimmy Iovine achieved is to explode a niche industry into the mainstream. How many people did you see buying £250 heaphones before Beats? That is nothing short of a miracle. This makes me think the deeper reason Apple wants Beats Electronic, is because they want Jimmy Iovine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet somehow, in all this news about headphones and music streaming, they forgot about Iovine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[dot net notts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Marvin Rounce and I are thrilled to announce  dot net notts , a user group for .NET stack developers.

Cosmetically it has lots of the typical nicks and scratches from an 18 month old black iPhone 5, but anecdotally the screen seems more resisitant to cracking when dropped. I speak from experience after dropping my iPhone from pocket height &lt;em&gt;with a case on&lt;/em&gt; and still having the screen crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there are situations where I wouldn’t be comfortable using my iPhone without a case, and travelling to the Arctic Circle is one of them. When Snugg offered me the case to review, Finland seemed like the ideal place to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you notice is the weight, or the lack of it. I find it hard to tell if the case is on purely by weight alone. But, you will certainly notice the bulk. It makes the iPhone feel twice as thick as it normally does, which makes it more comfortable to hold, especially with gloves on. Personally I don’t like how bulky the case is, but those with bigger hands might prefer it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem is how close the edge wraps over the front, this makes doing edge gestures much harder, something common in iOS 7 for common actions like swiping back in Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is reasonably well made, although it does feel a bit flimsy around the volume and wake/sleep buttons. Expect those areas to suffer first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall if you’re in the market for an iPhone case and fancy something with an exotic material, the Snugg Bamboo Case is a pretty good case. Personally, I prefer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MF045ZM/A/iphone-5s-case-black&quot;&gt;leather Apple iPhone case&lt;/a&gt; as the attention to detail and workmanship are the best of any case I’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Neil Young's Pono]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why push back against 24/192?

&lt;p&gt;Why push back against 24/192? Because it’s a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist, a business model based on willful ignorance and scamming people. The more that pseudoscience goes unchecked in the world at large, the harder it is for truth to overcome truthiness… even if this is a small and relatively insignificant example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dansdata.com/gz145.htm&quot;&gt;rational people get duped&lt;/a&gt; by this kind of psuedo-science when it involves music.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Google Needs 'Don't Be Evil']]></title><description><![CDATA[“Don’t be evil” is synonymous with Google, it’s their corporate identity.

But have you ever stopped and wondered why? Why does Google need to remind itself that it needs be good, and why it’s their slogan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s strategy is to sell advertising. To do that, it needs to collect user data in order to show relevant adverts so it’s customers will buy more ads. The nature of this strategy pushes Google towards being evil. It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to collect very personal and sensitive information about it’s users, and some of the best minds in technology are working at better ways to collect information and sell ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It still boggles my mind how many people don’t see Google’s motivations, and what they may or may not do with all the data Google is collecting about them. They see Google as a company that offers them lots of free software for nothing in return, and they are only too happy to use it. To them, “Don’t be evil” doesn’t have (or need) a paticular meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the users who are conscious of Google’s strategy, this is where the motto “Don’t be evil” really starts to make sense. If you are aware, then there is a constant tension between how many of Google’s great products you should use, and the amount of data you are willing to give to Google. What are they going to do with this data? Who are they going to sell it to? Do I even know what data they are collecting about me? “Don’t be evil” is designed to placates these questions, and to remove the tension from using their products. Google’s ongoing success with online services is evidence that “Don’t be evil” was a brilliant move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have a choice, a choice to use products from companies with a strategy that doesn’t push them towards being evil, companies that don’t need “Don’t be evil” as their motto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vote with your data, don’t give it to Google.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The new-new Mac Pro]]></title><description><![CDATA[Lots of people were worried when the  new-old Mac Pro  was released last June.

It was an incredibly incremental update, with slightly newer CPUs and a slightly reduced price. People interpreted this as Apple abandoning the pro desktop market in favour of their prosumer models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They couldn’t have been more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t want to just make another version of the same old desktop idea that everyone’s had. Like with MacBook Air, our engineering team has spent quite a bit of time thinking about the technology available today and what could be possible for the future of the pro desktop, what would be a new form factor, new design, &lt;strong&gt;new capabilities for another ten years&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/&quot;&gt;new-new Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; embodies what Apple does best, completely rethink a product and refine it’s category. This almost always leads to complaints from some users who aren’t happy with the changes made. The lack of internal expansion or upgradability is the main gripe, and another is that the smaller doesn’t benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their ideal scenario would’ve been to keep the old Mac Pro case, and stuff it with the latest internals. But if Apple did that, it would be another sign of the demise of the Mac Pro, a sign that they didn’t care. But by putting the effort into redesigning and rethinking the concept of a pro desktop computer, Apple has set the standard of the next generation desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will we see more pro desktop machines from competitors similar to the Mac Pro? I’m sure Samsung already has one in the works, but given the history of how long it took them to respond to the MacBook Air, I wouldn’t hold my breath.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPhone and iPod Touch]]></title><description><![CDATA[Apple’s  new budget iPod Touch  is the first iOS device with a black bezel and silver metal back since the first iPhone.

&lt;p&gt;Just send your users an email. The activation email is a practice that’s been in use for years, but it’s often paired with complex validations that the email is formatted correctly.

&lt;p&gt;The new interface is said to be “very, very flat,” according to one source. Another person said that the interface loses all signs of gloss, shine, and skeumorphism seen across current and past versions of iOS. Another source framed the new OS as having a level of “flatness” approaching recent releases of Microsoft’s Windows Phone “Metro” UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t matter that every major U.S. electronics company assembles its products under the same working conditions — or worse. Or that Apple was actually doing something about them. (Tim Cook called the Times’ implication that Apple didn’t care what happened to its subcontractors’ workers “patently false and offensive.“)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, the New York Times knows how to win Pulitzers — better than any other journalistic operation. It has now won a record 112. It employs editors who specialize in identifying Pulitzer-winning topics and assigning reporters who will bring them home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what it set out to do — with Apple as its conspicuous subject — in seven major stories capped with a self-serving kicker that suggested that it was Times’ reporting that led to substantive changes in the working conditions in China’s electronics factories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess winning is a higher priority than being correct.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don't be a Padhole]]></title><description><![CDATA[Glad to see Maddox back at his best.

&lt;p&gt;Tablets can take pictures, but tablets can also slice cheese, stop doors from closing and fix wobbly tables. The day I start seeing people fix wobbly tables and slicing cheese with tablets is the day I’ll relax my stance on tablet photos. But don’t count on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Siegel%2BGale+clients+samsung&quot;&gt;exhaustive research&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to determin that Samsung is actually a client of Siegle+Gale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting plan here is to use .search to operate a redirect service on the “on the ‘dotless’ .search domain (&lt;a href=&quot;http://search/&quot;&gt;http://search/&lt;/a&gt;) that, combined with a simple technical standard, will allow a consistent query interface across firms that provide search functionality, and will enable users to easily conduct searches with firms that provide the search functionality that they designate as their preference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the biggest search engine would control the new ‘search’ domain, other search engines would have to beg them for access, and they would be privvy to every search performed through that top level domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds great.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple didn't ban comic but got the blame anyway]]></title><description><![CDATA[We did not interpret the content in question as involving any particular sexual orientation, and frankly that would have been a completely…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/4/apple-didnt-ban-comic-but-got-the-blame-anyway/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/4/apple-didnt-ban-comic-but-got-the-blame-anyway/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2013 19:02:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not interpret the content in question as involving any particular sexual orientation, and frankly that would have been a completely irrelevant consideration under any circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, it should be clear that Apple did not reject Saga #12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing from Apple this morning, we can say that our interpretation of its policies was mistaken. You’ll be glad to know that Saga #12 will be available on our App Store app soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google knew what it was doing when it made and marketed Android as an “open” system. It surely anticipated forks by handset makers as a manageable risk as long as Google kept advancing the system. But I wonder if it expected something like Facebook Home: an inside-out heist, made by a company after the same exact user data and advertisers Google is after. How it chooses to respond in the near future should give us an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the group’s model bills, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://alecexposed.org/w/images/f/f5/7K13-The_Animal_and_Ecological_Terrorism_Act_%28AETA%29_Exposed.pdf&quot;&gt;The Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act&lt;/a&gt;,” prohibits filming or taking pictures on livestock farms to “defame the facility or its owner.” Violators would be placed on a “terrorist registry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the land of the free, you can’t record interactions with the police, you can’t publish leaked information if it embaresses the government, and you’re branded a terrorist if you try to expose animal cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple changes VPN on Demand behaviour due to lawsuit]]></title><description><![CDATA[Devices using iOS 6.1 and later with VPN On Demand configured to “Always” will behave as if they were configured with the “Establish if…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/4/apple-changes-vpn-on-demand-behaviour-due-to-lawsuit/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/4/apple-changes-vpn-on-demand-behaviour-due-to-lawsuit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2013 07:41:23 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices using iOS 6.1 and later with VPN On Demand configured to “Always” will behave as if they were configured with the “Establish if needed” option. The device will establish a VPN On Demand connection only if it is unable to resolve the DNS name of the host it is trying to reach. This change will be distributed in an update later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will only affect iOS devices that are configured with an enterprise configuration profile that mandates traffic to certain servers always be through a VPN.&lt;/p&gt;

No it’s not real multitasking, inter-app communication, or reliable data syncing. It’s never had an animated assistant based on office stationary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well you’re in luck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to get Clippy in your app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download or clone the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/weiran/NSClippy&quot;&gt;NSClippy repository on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Include all the files in /NSClippy (excluding the Example directory) in your project, or use &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoapods.org&quot;&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pod &amp;#39;NSClippy&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding Clippy to your view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NSClippy *clippy = [[NSClippy alloc] initWithAgent:@&amp;quot;clippy&amp;quot;];
[self.view addSubview:clippy];
[clippy show];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to show an animation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[clippy showAnimation:@&amp;quot;GetArtsy&amp;quot;];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now you’ll have to move him and make his speech bubble yourself. If you do give him the power of speech, please be kind and submit a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs was a master at dealing with the press, he knew exactly what to do to keep them on their toes, that was to keep them guessing. Since the unveiling of the iPod and iMac, the mood in the mainstream press has been relatively positive for Apple, leaving little reason to change this tactic that has worked for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since Apple’s success with the iPhone and iPad, the mainstream press has become increasingly hostile to Apple. They’ve discovered that while any article about Apple gets a comparatively high number of hits, an article with a negative slant has a much higher chance of becoming viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that this is the result of being on top, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult for Apple to maintain their public image while being silent. The press will always speculate on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_the_glass_half_empty_or_half_full%3F&quot;&gt;glass half empty&lt;/a&gt; point of view even if the facts point to a different conclusion. Without the other side to the discussion, Apple is exposed to knee-jerk opinions, such as people who saw or read about Mike Daisey’s play, “The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs, even though it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/blog/2012/03/retracting-mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory&quot;&gt;mostly fabricated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As an aside, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction&quot;&gt;the retraction&lt;/a&gt; by This American Life of their Mike Daisey episode is possibly one of the greatest This Amercian Life episodes I’ve heard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple now has to fight for it’s own position, and part of that is responding publicly to criticism no matter if it warrants a response. The public perception of Apple is becoming increasingly hostile, while their competitors now get the praise that Apple used to get. Tim Cook has to stem the turning tide before this starts to affect their bottom line, and I think we’ll be hearing a lot more from him in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why? Because of the founder Nick D’Aloisio. Since the aquisition, Big Media has focused so much on his age that I’ve yet to read an article about anything else. He is featured on newspapers and TV channels across the world as a 21st century success story, with Yahoo in the background as the protective parent. Getting Yahoo back into mainstream news in such a big way must be worth the investment alone. In other words, it’s an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techopedia.com/definition/28595/acqhire&quot;&gt;acqhire&lt;/a&gt; not in the traditional sense for talent, but for publicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The management-free organisation]]></title><description><![CDATA[I think the manager-free model only works for a business that has high margins and depends more on creating hits than cutting costs.

&lt;p&gt;I think the manager-free model only works for a business that has high margins and depends more on creating hits than cutting costs. The videogame business fits that model, as do many Internet businesses. And in both cases entrepreneurs can hire from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s my summary: Management only exists to compensate for its own poor hiring decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, 2010, I posted an essay on Core77 entitled ”&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.core77.com/blog/columns/design_thinking_a_useful_myth_16790.asp&quot;&gt;Design Thinking: A Useful Myth&lt;/a&gt;.” Since my essay was posted, I keep encountering people who jump to solutions and who fail to question assumptions—engineers, business people, and yes, designers (and design students). These encounters made me reconsider. I observed design students who were acting mindlessly, simply doing their assignments as presented. No creativity, no imagination, no questioning. That’s not what design thinking is about. As a result, I have changed my mind: Design Thinking really is special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the vulnerabilities can be exploited without privilege and according to Paleari, stem from “Samsung-specific software and customizations.” Paleari said two of the vulnerabilities can be used to silently install highly privileged applications without user interaction while another allows attackers to send SMS messages without permission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleari said he informed Samsung in mid-January shortly after he found the bugs and still hasn’t heard from the South Korean company about a fix. Instead, Paleari writes that Samsung did contact him on Feb. 20 and requested he delay public disclosure, insisting that “any patches [Samsung] develops must first be approved by the network carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This movie gets worse every screening”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Deckard at the piano is interminable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s how news reporters increasingly are treating the state of the industry. The desire for the “Oh, how the mighty Apple has fallen” narrative is so strong that the narrative is simply being stated as fact, evidence to the contrary be damned. It’s reported as true simply because they want it to be true. They’re declaring “The King is dead; long live the King” not because the king has actually died or abdicated the throne, but because they’re bored with the king and want to write a new coronation story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/305&quot;&gt;Apple’s real problems&lt;/a&gt;, this is just an interesting but annoying distraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft is dead]]></title><description><![CDATA[Microsoft’s biggest weakness is that they still don’t realize how much they suck.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s biggest weakness is that they still don’t realize how much they suck. They still think they can write software in house. Maybe they can, by the standards of the desktop world. But that world ended a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham’s on Microsoft is as relevant today as it was when it was written in 2007. Judging by their efforts with Windows 8, they still suck, 2013 is going to be a tough year for them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Reader creator reflects]]></title><description><![CDATA[“When they replaced sharing with +1 on Google Reader, it was clear that this day was going to come,” he said.

&lt;p&gt;“When they replaced sharing with +1 on Google Reader, it was clear that this day was going to come,” he said. Wetherell, 43, is amazed that Reader has lasted this long. Even before the project saw the light of the day, Google executives were unsure about the service and it was through sheer perseverance that it squeaked out into the market. At one point, the management team threatened to cancel the project even before it saw the light of the day, if there was a delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think many of us can relate to working on a dead project, but what many of us can’t relate to is working on a dead project with so many vocal users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be hard for him to never see Reader reach it’s full potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google removes Adblock from Play store]]></title><description><![CDATA[Not so open after all.]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/3/google-removes-adblock-from-play-store/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/3/google-removes-adblock-from-play-store/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 09:18:02 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Not so open after all.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Andy Rubin steps down as Head of Android]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’m not entirely sure what to make of this, but Rubin’s replacement Sundar Pichai has proven himself with the Chrome browser and it will be…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/3/andy-rubin-steps-down-as-head-of-android/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/3/andy-rubin-steps-down-as-head-of-android/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2013 19:10:58 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely sure what to make of this, but Rubin’s replacement Sundar Pichai has proven himself with the Chrome browser and it will be interesting to see how his approach wil differ from Rubin’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his insight immediately struck a chord because at the time it was extremely painful developing services for mobile devices. We had a closet full of more than 100 phones and were building our software pretty much device by device. It was nearly impossible for us to make truly great mobile experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty ironic given how difficult it is to develop an app that suits every Android device in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Living with a lot less]]></title><description><![CDATA[Graham Hill describes what happened after he sold his first start-up in the 90s: My life was unnecessarily complicated.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life was unnecessarily complicated. There were lawns to mow, gutters to clear, floors to vacuum, roommates to manage (it seemed nuts to have such a big, empty house), a car to insure, wash, refuel, repair and register and tech to set up and keep working. To top it all off, I had to keep Seven busy. And really, a personal shopper? Who had I become? My house and my things were my new employers for a job I had never applied for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We launched the WebM Project in May 2010 with the goal of providing the web with a high-quality, open, royalty-free video codec that anyone can use, and that can inspire future innovators. Today’s announcement is an important step toward that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So VP8 wasn’t as patent unencumbered as Googled claimed back in 2010. It took nearly three years for Google to license those patents, no doubt a difficult task but hopefully one that creates a future for VP8.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gnome founder uses Macs]]></title><description><![CDATA[I wonder if he’ll continue this as a long winded three parter.]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/3/gnome-founder-uses-macs/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/3/gnome-founder-uses-macs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2013 09:11:15 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if he’ll continue this as a long winded three parter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's mini lessons]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since the iPhone 3G, Apple has recycled old iPhone models to be the low end model.

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the iPhone 3G, Apple has recycled old iPhone models to be the low end model. As Apple produces more of each model, it’s profit margin increases to the point where the price can be reduced. This has worked very well, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://seekingalpha.com/article/1130391-apple-disappointed-in-part-due-to-supply-constraints&quot;&gt;the iPhone 4 supply constrained in the entirety of Q4 2012&lt;/a&gt; despite being two-years old, some people want an iPhone while paying as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while it may be profitable, no-one gets excited about buying a two year old phone, you don’t get the media attention that a new phone would create and it’s much harder to market a new price point rather than a new product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has taken this approach with iPads as well, the iPad 2 being demoted to a low end model when the iPad 3 was released. The iPad 2 remained a strong seller even though it lacked the spectacular Retina display, but with the release of the iPad 4 Apple introduced the iPad mini, a new, cheaper iPad which is now rumoured to be the best selling model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s clear that the mini has several technical advantages over the existing models: weight, size, appearance have all been improved, it got significant mindshare well before it was announced. The endless rumours, mockups, fake photographs, supply chain leaks, all culminating in an Apple product announcement covered by the media worldwide. Even if Apple had a comparable existing product to the mini, discounting that model by $100 wouldn’t have generated anywhere near as much attention as releasing a new product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I think the next budget iPhone will be a brand new model. Even if the hardware is based on an existing iPhone, Apple has learned with the iPad mini, that it’s worthwhile to take a short term hit in profit margin to gain more market and mind share with a new model. Apple used this strategy with the iPod as well, releasing an iPod mini which itself cannibalised their own iPod sales and then became the dominant model. I can only speculate why Apple changed their strategy with the iPhone, perhaps they went too far in chasing higher profit margins. Whatever the reason, Apple are showing signs that it’s learned from that mistake, and they are developing a new iPhone model that has the opportunity to take the iPhone’s success to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has a lower P/E ratio than Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and now Dell, to name a few. I find this baffling and I would challenge any analyst to articulate to me how Apple is not healthier and stronger, competitively, in the long-term than many of those companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple but powerful message is this: ‘Enjoy The Journey’. Remember the smile on Andy’s face when he disposes off the pieces from the wall every day in that prison ground? It could be the light at the end of the tunnel that keeps you going, or it could be the thrill that comes from the stealthiness of it all – but you have to remember that the journey is more important and satisfying than the end destination – getting into that mode is absolutely essential for everyone embarking on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have no idea how deep the wall is. You have nothing but a rock hammer. You have no idea when you will be caught. But what you do have, is the journey. Enjoy the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers is an iPhone app designed for reading Hacker News on the go. I took a content first approach to the design which has resulted in a minimalist style. It takes some getting used to, especially not having separators between table cells, but with distinctive headers I didn’t feel it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers focuses on the most common way of reading Hacker News on an iPhone, during travelling or while waiting in queues. You may not have time to read a whole article and all the comments, but you have enough to skim the top posts and their top comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve released Hackers as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/weiran/Hackers&quot;&gt;open source project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Please fork it, play around, and install it on your iPhone for free if you have developer account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer the convenience of having automatic updates, you can buy Hackers on the App Store for £1.49 ($1.99):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully people can learn from my mistakes and particular ways I’ve implemented features. At the least it’s an entry into the crazy world of AutoLayout with Storyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be continually working on Hackers, there are several features I’d like for the next version as well as iPad support. If you’d like to suggest something, create a new issue on GitHub, get in touch via Twitter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/weiran&quot;&gt;@weiran&lt;/a&gt;, or implement it yourself and send me a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Strip launches UK beta]]></title><description><![CDATA[Fantastic news, payment processor Strip finally comes to the UK.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, this just doesn’t feel right. It gives the impression that a judge who deals Samsung’s number one rival a huge PR blow, in a way that I found very extreme and unjustified, will be generously rewarded. For that reason alone, I think both Samsung and Sir Robin Jacob should not have done this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess Samsung liked what they saw.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No one left to speak out]]></title><description><![CDATA[The UK High Court has  ordered UK ISPs to block more torrent sites  at the whim of the BPI, a private company representing the interests of…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/no-one-left-to-speak-out/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/no-one-left-to-speak-out/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2013 12:19:52 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The UK High Court has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21601609&quot;&gt;ordered UK ISPs to block more torrent sites&lt;/a&gt; at the whim of the BPI, a private company representing the interests of music labels, despite data showing that blocking these sites have little effect on copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;

Then they decided to block &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom#.22Extreme.22_pornography&quot;&gt;violent porn sites&lt;/a&gt;, and then terrorist sites.

Certainly not me. For whatever reason, other ‘brands’ seem reluctant to compete with Apple in this new class of notebook computer. Sony, Asus, and Lenovo all have notebooks at similar prices, but none have a high density display and none have only solid state storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why? Why have some of the biggest technology companies been unable to compete with Apple, especially considering the display itself doesn’t contain any Apple intellectual property. The answer is found when reading any &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/25/4023830/google-chromebook-pixel-review&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; of Google’s Chromebook Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, Google’s Chromebook Pixel is a highly impressive piece of hardware. The industrial design is attractive and distinctive, the build quality is up there with the best, and as a bonus the ugly Google logo is nowhere to be seen. But almost all of the reviews mention the same three problems: price, battery life, and the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe £1049 (or $1299) is a reasonable price for hardware like the Pixel, but the value proposition is poor when compared with a MacBook Pro. The Pixel runs an OS that is essentially just a very good web browser. While Chrome OS is improving, I think it’s still a few years too early for most people to use as their main or only operating system. Mac OS X is a better OS with more flexibility, and is found on computers costing about the same amount for similar or better hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If another manufacturer were to offer a high DPI laptop, they’d have to use Windows 8. The new Metro side of Windows 8 scales well with Retina displays, but the old Windows desktop has never supported high DPI displays, and I don’t think it’s about to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final piece of the puzzle is battery life, something that’s always suffered when using bleeding edge technology. Chromebooks started off as low cost, big battery laptops, but with the Chromebook Pixel, Google has run into a technical hurdle they can’t surmount to get anywhere near the 8-10 hours their prototype Chromebook CR-48 did. Reviews have found it gets around four hours, which is about 25% less than a 13” Retina MacBook Pro, which has a 20% bigger battery. Considering the Pixel uses a slower, lower power CPU either the display uses a lot more power or Chrome OS is inefficient on x86 CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt battery life would be much better if the Pixel ran Windows 8. Apple has such a head start in this area due to their experience with integrating hardware and software, that if any competitor were to release a product right now, it would have to compromise performance, weight, size, price, or battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google are currently the only company that is willing to take on Apple and welcome in the brave new world of notebook computing. I see no mention of the actual manufacturer or whether Google are making a profit on it (I think their margins are very slim). This is just a hobby for Google like the Apple TV is a hobby for Apple, but it’s nice seeing someone else &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2752-a-good-hockey-player-plays-where-the-puck&quot;&gt;skating to where the puck is going&lt;/a&gt; instead of where it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People would have happily waited longer for a comprehensive, exciting product launch. It’s been nearly seven years since the last PlayStation was revealed; would another month or two have tipped some scale? Whoever this was aimed at — developers, hardcore gamers, casual gamers — the utter lack of usable information makes the timing questionable at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony has a history of botched product announcements, and it seems they haven’t learned anything.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG buys webOS, HP keeps cloud services]]></title><description><![CDATA[HP is selling key parts of it’s webOS product to LG, although interestingly HP are keeping the backend services such as cloud sync and the…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/lg-buys-webos-hp-keeps-cloud-services/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/lg-buys-webos-hp-keeps-cloud-services/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2013 08:23:39 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;HP is selling key parts of it’s webOS product to LG, although interestingly HP are keeping the backend services such as cloud sync and the app store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I saw was a fluke in app store pricing,” he told me. “If you have an app, you can charge, realistically, about $3 these days.” Somebody buys the app, and that’s it. But for a magazine, you can charge $1.99 every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impressively, The Magazine already has 25,000 subscribers and turns a profit of $15,000 every month.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Chromebook Pixel]]></title><description><![CDATA[A highly impressive notebook from Google, I love the industrial design and of course the 2560x1700 resolution display.

&lt;p&gt;This is what Google can do when they integrate software and hardware, imagine the phones they could produce if they did this with Android. Maybe this is an experiment that will influence their future decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movist has long been one of my favourite video players for the Mac. The simplicity of it’s interface and it’s speed has kept me from using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videolan.org&quot;&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://mplayerx.org&quot;&gt;MPlayerX&lt;/a&gt;. I simply perfer the way Movist ‘feels’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Movist project is hosted on Google Code, unfortunately there hasn’t been any activity since April 2010. But being open source, Nur Monson has &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/samiamwork/Movist/&quot;&gt;forked the project onto GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and resolved the many problems with getting it to build with the latest Xcode and made it a ‘modern’ OS X application, removing reliance on depreciated APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully now that Nur has given the project a solid foundation again, it will once again flourish as an active open source project with an engaged community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out, I’ve built the latest version &lt;a href=&quot;/weiran.co/s/Movist.zip&quot;&gt;which you can download here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google has killed the Android brand]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have seen the Android brand disappear over time.

&lt;p&gt;I have seen the Android brand disappear over time. First, it was the Nexus, then Samsung came with the Galaxy brand, who made Android less relevant. Now, Android is just invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought Google was losing a war against its partners, but I finally concluded that it cannot be just a coincidence. It is not just a trend. It is a deliberate effort. By Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google wants Google to be the brand, not Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: I can’t find any mention of Android in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20100319002511/http://www.google.com/phone&quot;&gt;original Google Nexus site&lt;/a&gt;, apart from once in the specification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA['Innovation']]></title><description><![CDATA[‘iHKDesign’ responds to an idiotic article on CNN claiming that Samsung is ‘out innovating Apple’: It seems to me that today, innovation…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/innovation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/innovation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2013 12:34:29 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;‘iHKDesign’ responds to an idiotic article on CNN claiming that Samsung is ‘out innovating Apple’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that today, innovation means a feature that Apple decided not to implement. This is a very stupid way of thinking. All the things that Kovach listed in his articles were features with caveats. Innovation is redefining an entire product category, something Apple has done at least five times (Macintosh, iPod, iTunes Music Store, iPhone, and iPad). Innovation can’t be bought, it can’t be created through ads, and innovation is not just merely strapping on features to an OS. That is laziness. And writing an article like the one he did is just plain old bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Cook refers to integration and a great team as unique Apple advantages (but also note the references to magic and belief.) It’s a better explanation but it is still hard to understand why nobody copies this approach. Integration is something that can take a long time, but it is possible with a Herculean effort. A few companies are starting to make moves in that direction (e.g. Microsoft.) But efforts are half-hearted. There is no “move the Earth” panic to become an integrated company from Samsung, Google or Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with Microsoft’s online service offerings isn’t that their TV campaigns are lame. It’s not even that the products are bad. But they’re not wildly better than Google’s search and email and so forth. Most people are just incredibly lazy. It’s easy to forget, but it took Google Search and Gmail a remarkably long time to rise to dominance during a period when they wiped the floor with the competition on the merits. Now Google has that change-aversion and laziness working in its favor. To beat them, you have to crush them on quality. And Microsoft’s not doing that. No ad campaign can overcome the basic reality of human inertia.&lt;/p&gt;

It reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs when he was pissed off&lt;/a&gt;. But while on the surface Musk’s arguments seem compelling, digging a bit deeper shows cracks and the same sort of biased analysis and prejudice that resulted in Broder’s original conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Greenfield at The Atlantic Wire had a look at the data presented by Musk, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/02/elon-musks-data-doesnt-back-his-claims-new-york-times-fakery/62149/&quot;&gt;found it less than conclusive&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of Musk’s data is entirely convincing and the parts that are don’t point to a malicious plot. In the end, it looks like Broder made some compromises to get from the Newark charging station to the Milford one, in both speed and temperature. Broder may not have used Musk’s car the way Musk would like, but Musk is, for now, overhyping his case for a breach of journalism ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does look like Musk’s interpretation of the data is prejudiced to conform to his existing conclusion, which is ironic as that’s exactly what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teslamotors.com/teslavstopgear&quot;&gt;he accused Top Gear of doing&lt;/a&gt; when they reviewed the Tesla Roadster. These claims were &lt;a href=&quot;http://transmission.blogs.topgear.com/2011/04/02/tesla-vs-top-gear-andy-wilman-on-our-current-legal-action/&quot;&gt;refuted by Top Gear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://transmission.blogs.topgear.com/2012/02/23/tesla-libel-action-against-top-gear-fails-again/&quot;&gt;thrown out of court twice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Justice Tugendhat said that Tesla’s second attempt to formulate their malicious falsehood case on damage was so “vague” and so “gravely deficient” that “it is impossible to say that it has a real prospect of success or is in respect of a real and substantial tort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem Tesla and Elon Musk now face is the boy who cried wolf syndrome (I just made that up). Broder might well have skewed his interpretation of the facts to over-dramatise the negativity of the review, but it doesn’t look like he’s a malicious, oil-lobbying, corporate stooge either. Certainly, there is very little case of libel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Korean lawmaker who exposed Samsung's corruption forced from office]]></title><description><![CDATA[Roh, who was a lawmaker for the opposition Progressive Justice Party, has been a vocal critic of Samsung, South Korea’s most powerful…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/korean-lawmaker-who-exposed-samsungs-corruption-forced-from-office/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/korean-lawmaker-who-exposed-samsungs-corruption-forced-from-office/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2013 12:59:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roh, who was a lawmaker for the opposition Progressive Justice Party, has been a vocal critic of Samsung, South Korea’s most powerful conglomerate, which dominates the country’s economy. In testimony to the National Assembly in 2005, he used the wiretapped conversations to call for an investigation into Samsung’s relationships with prosecutors. The probe led to the resignation of a vice justice minister but prosecutors only indicated Roh and a journalist for releasing the wiretaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually South Korean lawmakers are protected by an immunity that allows them to speak freely in the National Assembly without being sued for libel or prosecuted for other charges. At issue was whether such immunity applied to the lawmaker’s actions in cyberspace. South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that it did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet Samsung is a much better company than “evil” Apple right?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Designing the packaging-free future]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some great ideas, like the rubbish bag packaged inside a rubbish bag.]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/designing-the-packaging-free-future/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/designing-the-packaging-free-future/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2013 09:22:19 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some great ideas, like the rubbish bag packaged inside a rubbish bag.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Plan B for Microsoft]]></title><description><![CDATA[The biggest mistake Microsoft could make is back down from the progress they’re making with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.

&lt;p&gt;When I started developing iOS apps, I looked at using &lt;a href=&quot;http://xamarin.com/monotouch&quot;&gt;MonoTouch&lt;/a&gt; as I had been writing C# for many years. But I decided the pitfalls of using a third-party layer on top of Objective-C and Cocoa just wasn’t worth it.

&lt;p&gt;Dieter Rams formalized his 10 principles of good design and said that “Good design is as little design as possible.” Except that somewhere along the line, we started to believe that “as little design as possible” means “getting out of the way”. It doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rams didn’t say that good design disappears completely. “As little design as possible” is not about making things invisible, it’s about “not burdening products with non-essentials”. It’s about making the right choices about what should be there, and what shouldn’t. There is nothing wrong with making the things that are in the product visible, sometimes very much so. Let’s not forget that one Rams’s other principles is that “Good design is aesthetic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview this week, Mr Heins hailed the success of his company’s new phones, saying that sales in the UK were “beyond expectations”. Talking about the Z10 - one of two new BlackBerry handsets unveiled last week - he added: “White is sold out already. The black is hard to stock up again. It’s very encouraging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff at Phones 4U, the exclusive UK supplier of the white Z10, said that they have not sold out of the handsets. When the website Mobile News contacted the retailer’s customer services and two of its retail stores, all of them said the white handset was still in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe he’s confusing sold with shipped again.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Android fragmentation is a security flaw]]></title><description><![CDATA[In late October, researchers at North Carolina State University alerted Google to a security flaw that could let scam artists send phony…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/android-fragmentation-is-a-security-flaw/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/android-fragmentation-is-a-security-flaw/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2013 09:45:22 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late October, researchers at North Carolina State University alerted Google to a security flaw that could let scam artists send phony text messages to Android phones — a practice called “smishing” that can ensnare consumers in fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s security officials replied in minutes, confirming the flaw and promising to correct it. Within days they had incorporated a fix into the latest version of the Android operating system, Jelly Bean 4.2, and made available a security update for earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for most Android phones, the fix never arrived. For many, it never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because open is always better.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Who's being dishonest with storage space?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Good reporting from Ed Bott, when comparing the Surface Pro to a MacBook Air the amount of free space is about the same.

The problem is that people will naturally compare the Surface Pro with an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought what Bott fails to mention is you can delete the recovery partition on a MacBook Air and still use &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718&quot;&gt;Internet Recovery&lt;/a&gt; to restore OS X. On the Surface Pro, if you want to recover the space used by the recovery partition you have to create an external USB recovery drive that you’ll almost certainly lose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why did Dell buy Dell]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is Dell’s Battle of Britain.

&lt;p&gt;This is Dell’s Battle of Britain. This could be his finest hour or it could be him and his ego, like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid’s last stand against the Bolivian army. Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do it? My explanation — you don’t really have a rational choice, so you make an emotional choice. As a founder whose name adorns the shingle outside the door, Dell is playing a high stakes poker to literally save his good name. Just the idea that some faceless Asian company would own “Dell” the brand and his name is anathema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Dell is going all-in, good luck to him. Hopefully he’ll come with something more than just a commodity PC manufacturer at the other side.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Civilized Discourse Construction Kit]]></title><description><![CDATA[Discourse  is a new ‘discussion platform’ to replace the old, slow, and over-complicated forum software like phpBB.

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of the article is towards then end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this very clearly in the new Samsung Superbowl ad. This has got lots of attention by (depending on your point of view) mocking Apple for trying to patent basic concepts or brazenly flaunting Samsung’s systematic copying of Apple’s innovations. But to me, what’s striking is that it doesn’t show the phones or any features, let alone mention Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subtext, of course, is: ‘the UX is a commodity, the apps are a commodity, the stuff Apple talks about is a commodity that’s absurd to patent - we’re going to compete on hardware features’. That’s a natural angle for a hardware company with no control over the platform, of course. For now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The right to have root on your machine,” that is, full administrator access to your computing devices including smartphones, is a “key issue,” Sir Tim Berners-Lee told a geek-heavy audience at the Linux.conf.au 2013 conference in Canberra this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The right to have root on your machine is the right to store things which operate on your behalf,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s two separate issues here, the right to have root (or administrative) access to your device, and the right to have control over your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very fussy about keeping control over my data. I write mostly in Markdown, an open data format that is stored in text files. It’s unlikely that I won’t be able to read or edit what I’ve written in 50 years time because no one supports that file format anymore. To me, my data is timeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the device and software I use is only temporal. It’s likely in 10 years time we’ll be using a different operating system. Whether that software is open or locked down, it doesn’t matter as long as my data is ‘free’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of using a walled-garden approach like Apple outweigh the freedom offered by root access. At least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee also spoke out against the trend of writing a native application for every platform — that is, an iPhone and iPad app for Apple’s iOS devices, another for Android, and so on. It’s a duplication of effort, and it’s “boring for developers” to write and test similar code for each device, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that it’s much more ‘boring’ testing designs for web browsers, as it involves testing on several different browsers and maybe even different version of each browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a native app is currently a necessity if you want to create something that’s best of breed. None of the HTML5 frameworks or even proprietary cross-platform frameworks even come close to writing a native app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee pointed to the Financial Times’ award-winning mobile site at m.ft.com as an example of what can be achieved. “Once you load the page, it pulls in all the pages of today’s paper and sticks them on your device…just as though you’re running an app,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Use the fact that, more and more, you can do [in HTML5] the things that a native app can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I applaud the &lt;a href=&quot;app.ft.com&quot;&gt;Financial Times’ mobile site&lt;/a&gt;, it still doesn’t compare well to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-magazine.org&quot;&gt;good native app&lt;/a&gt;. There are issues with the layout, performance, and responsiveness. It is clearly not a native app and rather a HTML web app, so saying it can do everything a native app can do is rather disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Utopian future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee promotes his own creations, and he’s well within his rights to. In the long term the web should be protected, but I don’t think it’s as ‘open’ as he claims it to be, most websites we visit are closed source and controlled by corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native apps are just another way to write high performance web apps that run on mobile devices, it solves a problem we have now until we have the capability to solve it in a more cross-platform way in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Eminem is one of the most impressive lyricists ever]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mike Lombardo explains exactly why Eminem is such a good lyricist.]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/why-eminem-is-one-of-the-most-impressive-lyricists-ever/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/2/why-eminem-is-one-of-the-most-impressive-lyricists-ever/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 13:56:07 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mike Lombardo explains exactly why Eminem is such a good lyricist.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What would a 5" iPhone look like?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Marco Arment speculates that a 5” iPhone isn’t as unlikely as it seems, and mocks up how it might look.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would Apple release this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, there’s significant demand for larger-screened phones. As much as we make fun of the Galaxy Note, it sells surprisingly well, especially outside of the United States. Other large Android phones sell very well almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone has lost a significant number of sales by buyers either wanting a larger screen or being drawn to how much better the large screens look in stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree the iPhone has lost sales because of the lack of a larger model, I don’t know if it’s ‘significant’. I believe Apple haven’t made a larger phone yet because they think the current size is the best they can make and is selling incredibly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I prefer smaller to larger phones, I even find the iPhone 5 screen slightly too big. But the iPhone is now the only device in the iOS and Mac family not to have more than one screen size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[More on the 'new' Apple TV]]></title><description><![CDATA[An Apple spokesman told TNW that the new Apple TV model is just a in-season silent upgrade: “We sometimes make component changes which…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/1/more-on-the-new-apple-tv/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/1/more-on-the-new-apple-tv/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2013 11:00:38 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An Apple spokesman told TNW that the new Apple TV model is just a in-season silent upgrade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We sometimes make component changes which require an updated model number for regulatory approval,” an Apple spokesperson told TNW. “The component changes we made don’t affect product features and Apple TV customers will continue to have the same great user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/2013/01/31/appletv-a5xr2&quot;&gt;Like Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;, I now believe this new Apple TV is a test bed for production of a die-shrunk A5X SoC called the A5XR2, in the same way it was originally used to test the die shrunk A5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances of a Retina iPad mini appearing this year seem to be improving.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netbot for App.net now free]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tapbots, makers of Tweetbot, has made it’s App.net app  Netbot  free to encourage App.net adoption.

&lt;p&gt;If true, the only reason I can think why Apple put such a powerfup system on a chip into an Apple TV is gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Apple were to make a larger iPhone, I would guess a 4.8-inch screen with a 272ppi. I’m still not convinced though, I see no advantage over the existing iPhone 5 that makes the added bulk and weight worthwhile. But as Rene suggests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people are buying massive amounts of premium large-sized handsets, Apple could one day decide they’d rather those people buy premium Apple-made large-sized handsets than competing brands. If Apple sees value in increasing the scope of their addressable market, and thinks it will help them make a better product and sell more units, then that’s why Apple would add a bigger iPhone to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hysteria surrounding Apple’s business performance and its market positioning has led to perceptions about the state of Apple becoming unhinged from reality. Apple’s calendar year 2012 profits were the highest of any company in history, and its Q1 2013 earnings were the 4th largest quarterly profit of any company in history, behind only oil and gas companies Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Gazprom. Apple’s results for this quarter should be viewed on a weekly basis due to an extra week in Q1 2012, and on that basis, the company posted solid growth across many of its divisions. While Apple’s Q2 2013 guidance seems light, it needs to be viewed in the context of last year’s iPhone 4S launch and the presence of the iPad mini. And Apple’s aggressive operating expense and capital expenditure forecasts are implying that the company is readying for a material change in the second half of fiscal 2013, something that we believe is tied to the launch of a new product category, something that Apple has done every 3 years since 2001. We continue to believe that Apple’s best days are ahead of it, and think that this post-earnings selloff should be seen as a buying opportunity. In our view, investors who add to or initiate positions in Apple will be rewarded in the second half of 2013. Innovation is alive and well at Apple, and that innovation is likely to be put on full display in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

Although I’m not sure I agree with Kempin’s asssessment that Microsoft wasn’t successful in the tablet market because it didn’t follow through on it’s ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, Kempin writes about how Microsoft foresaw the major moves in technology in the last decade, but bungled its entry into tablets, phones and social media, ceding leadership in the technology world to Apple Inc and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They missed all the opportunities they were talking about when I was still in the company. Tablets, phones…we had a tablet going, we had tablet software when Windows XP came out, it was never followed up properly,” said Kempin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s ideas for phones and tablets were shit, following through on a shit idea isn’t going to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Flat UI is not the only way forward]]></title><description><![CDATA[Max Rudberg has a well-reasoned and moderate article on mobile design.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware and UI have different roles to play. The hardware is constant, not changing, and should take as little of your attention as possible. This goes perfectly in line with what Apple are doing; reducing the hardware to a minimum with clean lines and invisible seams. As technology gets better, the hardware gets out of the way even more. The hardware sets the stage for the user interface, and its content, to shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you launch an app on your mobile device, the device essentially becomes that app. Screens are great at drawing fine details and subtle gradients. Its part of a UI designers toolbox to make use of textures, shadows, light effects, etched or embossed elements and so on to make the UI tangible and understandable. I don’t see them going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all types of design, opinions about software design are easily influenced by fashion. Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogue_shoe&quot;&gt;styles go in-and-out of fashion&lt;/a&gt;, but after many years they persist and are recognised as truly great. This is what I think is Apple’s philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's churning of the gut]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have come to believe that the true cause is something bigger than all of this.

&lt;p&gt;I have come to believe that the true cause is something bigger than all of this. I think the right answer is that Apple just fails to pass the gut test for most people. It’s an incredulous reaction to Apple’s success. Look, how is it even remotely possible that a company with such a small market share could really be doing so well? How can a company that had so little success, a company that survived by the skin of its teeth in the PC era, be one of the largest companies in the world now? How can a company with so few products be such a behemoth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly believe people read their gut and say it can’t be possible therefore it isn’t. Apple can’t be this successful. It’s not possible. And I know that because my gut tells me so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of times I was short at my hedge fund, I would create a level of activity before hand that could drive the futures, it doesn’t take much money. Similarly if I was long, I would go in and take a bunch of stops and make sure they were higher. It takes about $10 million in capital to affect it, it’s a fun game, it’s a lucrative game. You can maybe move it up and then fade it, I’m going to boost the futures and then the real market takes it down. That creates a very negative view. I would encourage anyone who’s in a hedge fund to do it, because it’s legal, and a very quick way to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s important when you’re in that hedge fund mode, is not to do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, it’s important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. What would you do in you’re in that situation and you feel that you’re desperate. The great thing about the market is it’s got nothing to do with the actual stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two-weeks all the buyers will come to their senses and realise that everything they heard was a lie, it’s just fiction and fiction and fiction. It’s important for people to recognise that the way the market really works is to have that nexus of hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders that can push it down and leak it to the press, get it on CNBC, and then you have that vicious cycle down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest rumors about Apple slashing component orders, in fact, come on the heels of supposedly positive developments at competitors. First, we heard “good news” from Nokia, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/technology/nokia-sees-results-from-new-smartphone-line.html&quot;&gt;reported shipments of 4.4 million Lumia phones in the year-end quarter&lt;/a&gt;. Never mind that we are talking less than 2 percent market share for Nokia or that sales were boosted by heavy discounting, often down to $99 at retail — less than half what competing phones sell for. This is good news in the land of Nokia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Cnet was very excited about Samsung’s announcement that the Galaxy S phone line had &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57563765-94/samsung-weve-sold-100-million-galaxy-s-smartphones/&quot;&gt;crossed the 100 million mark in total sales&lt;/a&gt;. The phone is so desirable, “Sales of the flagship Galaxy S3 reached 30 million units in 5 months, and 40 million in 7 months, with average daily sales of about 190,000 units.” You’d think that it’s the hottest thing going with those numbers. Of course, as we were just discussing above, in the quarter just ended, Apple will have sold about as many iPhone 5′s as Samsung has sold Galaxy S3′s in 7 months! This is what the “experts” are already calling trouble and they haven’t seen the numbers yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, Samsung is also selling the prior generation S2, which Cnet tells us, “…is described as a steady bet after recording sales of over 40 million in 20 months.” So that’s about 2 million a month for that model to go with the 17 milllion S3 phones Samsung apparently moved in Q4. In other words, if we just compare the last two generations of phones, Apple sold somewhere around 35-45 million last quarter while Samsung moved about 23 million. It’s certainly true that Samsung has a number of less-expensive entry models and will outsell Apple in raw numbers. But when one looks at “profit share” and wonders why Apple will continue to earn more of it in smartphones than Samsung, those numbers tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;

Are the claims founded on fact or was it a cheap attempt to manipulate Apple’s stock before the earning’s call on January 23rd? Let’s have a look at the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I own a small number of Apple shares.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, to those who are waiting for an official response from Apple about these rumours, Jim Dalrymple on why &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/01/14/apple-cant-respond-to-rumors-of-iphone-5-cuts-even-if-it-wanted-to/&quot;&gt;Apple can’t respond to rumours of iPhone 5 cuts even if it wanted to&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC rules prohibit Apple from talking publicly about the company. This is known as a quiet period and all publicly traded companies must adhere to these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal can publish more of its “according to a person familiar with the matter” and there isn’t a lot Apple can say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon in the US announced last week that had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2013/01/09/verizon-wireless-says-9-8m-smartphone-activations-in-q4/&quot;&gt;strong holiday quarter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon this morning said in a filing with the SEC that its Verizon Wireless unit expects to report Q4 retail postpaid subscriber net adds of 2.1 million, with 9.8 million smartphone activations, and “a higher mix of Apple smartphones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=23658&amp;#x26;cdvn=news&amp;#x26;newsarticleid=35923&amp;#x26;mapcode=corporate%7Cfinancial&quot;&gt;Same with AT&amp;#x26;T&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;#x26;T announced today that it sold more than 10 million smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2012, topping its previous record quarter of 9.4 million, set in the fourth quarter of 2011. This included best-ever quarterly sales of Android and Apple smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Grothaus at TUAW speculates that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/14/wsj-apple-cuts-iphone-5-parts-order-due-to-weak-demand/&quot;&gt;Apple could be releasing a new iPhone on a six-month schedule&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple usually reduces component orders when they are getting ready to ramp up for a new product. There have been rumors that Apple will move to a six-month release schedule for its iOS devices to keep up with competition. The lower component orders could signal that an “iPhone 5S” can be expected sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although as &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/14/iphone-2013&quot;&gt;John Gruber points out&lt;/a&gt;, a new iPhone is almost certainly going to use the same display as the iPhone 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGR expands on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bgr.com/2013/01/14/iphone-5-analysis-component-cuts-291307/&quot;&gt;questionable maths used to reason that Apple cut display orders in half&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the most likely number of 4-inch screens Apple is reasonably expected to sell in March quarter is around 30 to 40 million units, why did Nikkei publish a report stating that Apple had halved its display orders for the quarter from 65 million units? Nikkei was quite specific about the 65 million number. And it clearly tied it to iPhone 5 component orders, not total iPhone or iPhone 5 and iPod touch orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what world did Apple expect to order components for 65 million iPhone 5 handsets in the seasonally soft March quarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the weirdness of the math is why the current version of the WSJ article no longer cites the 65 million unit figure. Sometime between Sunday at 8:00 p.m. EST and Monday at 7:00 a.m., the Journal decided to drop the number from its article. But if the 65 million number is not right, is the estimate for halving March orders correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally from November last year, Joe Springer from Seeking Alpha expands on the incentives for keeping Apple’s stock price low until at least January 19:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of money are we talking? Let’s use the more than 60,000 calls with a $600 strike price. If Apple goes to $700 before January 19, then those options have an intrinsic value of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60,000 (call options) X 100 (shares per option) X $100 (intrinsic value per share) = $600,000,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six hundred million dollars not in the institutional call writers’ pockets. Whereas, if Apple stays put, then runs to $700 after the expiration date, the call writers get the capital gain from the common stock they covered with, AND the entire amount for which they sold the option. And this is only one strike price we calculated - together this is billions of dollars for a two month delay in an Apple surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, however, the gains of the Summer have come back in and Apple’s share price has only to stay flat for the next two months for all those call options to expire worthless. The institutional money managers that wrote those options, if they were to try to manipulate Apple’s share price, have a lot of incentive to keep Apple in place for a short time, then drive it higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. There may be some truth in the Wall Street Journal’s claim that Apple has cut orders for iPhone 5 displays, and (going against all previous experience) Tim Cook might have been wrong about iPhone demand. But given that the foundation of this story is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-story-thats-killing-apple-today-is-a-month-old-2013-1&quot;&gt;over a month old&lt;/a&gt;, the history of unreliable supply chain rumours, and the huge incentives to manipulate Apple’s stock to keep it low until a few days before the next earnings call, I know which theory I believe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A history of Apple products]]></title><description><![CDATA[Nice timeline of Apple’s products by Pop Chart Lab.]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/1/a-history-of-apple-products/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/1/a-history-of-apple-products/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 08:28:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nice timeline of Apple’s products by Pop Chart Lab.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The truth about Aaron Swartz's "crime"]]></title><description><![CDATA[Aaron Swartz was not the super hacker breathlessly described in the Government’s indictment and forensic reports, and his actions did not…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2013/1/the-truth-about-aaron-swartzs-crime/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2013/1/the-truth-about-aaron-swartzs-crime/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 10:14:56 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Swartz was not the super hacker breathlessly described in the Government’s indictment and forensic reports, and his actions did not pose a real danger to JSTOR, MIT or the public. He was an intelligent young man who found a loophole that would allow him to download a lot of documents quickly. This loophole was created intentionally by MIT and JSTOR, and was codified contractually in the piles of paperwork turned over during discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 787 Dreamliner has been vexed since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was convinced by one or more management consulting firms to outsource design and production of the 787’s components. While this idea might make sense for sourcing coffeemakers, it was a nonsense approach to assembling perhaps the most complicated and potentially dangerous machines shy of nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

It feels like a superfluous addition from the days when Android was more like Blackberry. iOS lets apps display their own back button in their UI, and results in a much less confusing experience for the user. The problem is, can Android handle the removal of all the permanent buttons, especially the back and menu button, when so many apps depend on them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designers, having received a new property to play with, began to use the antialiasing mode everywhere on their text, even for large portions of dark text on light backgrounds. Disabling subpixel rendering made that text look different, more slender and without any hint of subpixel discoloration. Because of this, at first glance, antialiased text appears to look better than its subpixel sibling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But upon closer inspection, antialiased text is always blurrier than subpixel rendered text. This is not a matter of opinion, it’s just how the rendering works. Subpixel rendering utilizes each of the three individual subpixels in every pixel of the screen to smooth out and sharpen the edges of the font. Antialiasing relies on whole pixels only, which effectively reduces its smoothing sharpness by three times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky was the driving force behind the “no compromise” approach to Windows 8. I believe that approach is at the heart of the ultimate problem with the OS. As two separate halves, Windows 8 and Metro seem fine. As a whole, the OS seems like a schizophrenic mess. Microsoft should have copied the Apple approach with OS X/iOS, keeping them separate and slowly merging them over time by taking the best of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair to Sinofsky, Ballmer was also a big advocate of the “no compromise” approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft's Universal Translator]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the video, the speaker explains and demonstrates improvements made to the machine understanding of his English words, which are…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2012/11/microsofts-universal-translator/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2012/11/microsofts-universal-translator/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2012 22:19:01 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, the speaker explains and demonstrates improvements made to the machine understanding of his English words, which are automatically transcribed as he speaks. Microsoft, he says, has taken in oodles of data, and can thus have that translated Mandarin spoken. And the final kicker: he has fed the system an hour’s worth of his voice, and thus the software will speak in Mandarin, using his own tones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing demonstration from Microsoft Research, I can confirm that the translated Mandarin is very accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sentiment you often hear from people: casual users only need entry-level devices. Even casual users themselves perpetuate it: “Oh, I’m not doing much on my computer, so I always just go with the cheapest option”. And then they buy a horrid, underpowered netbook, find out that it has a tiny screen, is incredibly slow, the keyboard sucks, and they either never actually use it, or eventually come to the conclusion that they just hate computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, it’s exactly backwards: proficient users can deal with a crappy computer, but casual users need as good a computer as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t miss the Retina display as much as I thought I would, I love using Instapaper on the mini and the lower DPI isn’t an issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build quality is on par with the iPhone 5, very well made indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s much more practical than a full size iPad when used as a camera, but still clumsy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual display is still quite sunken from the glass, like the other iPads, but unlike the iPhone or iPod touch where the display is very close to the glass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new hinge-less Smart Cover is a big improvement. The angle in upright is more obtuse and natural, also making the iPad more stable. I wish they made a black one though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weight reduction is the biggest difference you notice, Apple definitely have to focus on reducing the weight of the next 10” iPad over anything else. My iPad 3 feels incredibly heavy after using the mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comes with an iPhone style charger (5W), not surprising considering the battery is under two-thirds of the capacity of the iPad 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will probably regret not getting the cellular model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of the lightweight iPad mini are apparent immediately. I don’t think it’s the size or price that will drive sales of the iPad mini, but once you hold it the lack of weight makes it a very attractive device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In combination with the lower price, I think the iPad mini has the ability to become the defacto iPad in the next 18 months to two years. If next year Apple can produce a Retina model with a similar weight and a A6X processor at the same price, it will be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; iPad.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK Search Safari Extension]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you live in the UK and use Safari, this extension redirects your Google searches to google.co.uk.]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2012/11/uk-search-safari-extension/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2012/11/uk-search-safari-extension/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2012 08:59:50 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you live in the UK and use Safari, this extension redirects your Google searches to google.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cook is the head, Ive is the heart, Schiller is the voice]]></title><description><![CDATA[Don Lehman analyses the ramifications of Apple’s recent management changes: Cook’s task of molding the executive team to work best for him…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2012/11/cook-is-the-head-ive-is-the-heart-schiller-is-the-voice/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2012/11/cook-is-the-head-ive-is-the-heart-schiller-is-the-voice/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 12:36:13 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Don Lehman analyses the ramifications of Apple’s recent management changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook’s task of molding the executive team to work best for him is set for the next 5-10 years. Instead of individuals running product teams, he now has them geared towards discipline teams. This allows the executive team to function with the flexibility of a small startup. They are responsible for coming up with Apple’s strategy and product, and each member is amplified by the strength of the team that reports to them. It should be pretty exciting to see how this plays out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question is why Google is so beholden to the carriers. And the answer goes back to the very beginnings of Android, when Google gave up control in order to speed adoption of the platform. Apple took the world by surprise completely with the iPhone and Google had Android in their pocket already. So they pivoted it from a BlackBerry clone into a full touch-screen OS and shopped it out to the carriers and manufacturers as a way for them to get a smartphone on the market to compete with Apple that they could still shove their crapware and carrier billing systems into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a deal with the devil, made in a moment of desperation, and it’s been haunting Google ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Surface is partially for Microsoft’s world of denial: the world in which this store contains no elephants and Microsoft invented the silver store with the glass front and the glowing logo and blue shirts and white lanyards and these table layouts and the modern tablet and its magnetic power cable. In that world, this is a groundbreaking new tablet that you can finally use at work and leave your big creaky plastic Dell laptop behind when you go to the conference room to have a conference call on the starfish phone with all of the wires and dysfunctional communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[They were] convicted because the public wanted revenge - and the scientists were their most obvious targets. Needless to say, this is having a chilling effect on scientists talking to the public. Enzo Boschi, president of Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) in Rome, said: “When people, when journalists, asked my opinion about things, I used to tell them, but no more. Scientists have to shut up.” Also, as part of their conviction, those scientists are prohibited from ever holding public office again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everyone welcomed updates to long neglected Macs in Apple’s line-up. The biggest one being the new iMac and MacBook Pro 13”. Only the new MacBook Pro with Retina Display is a big enough update to warrant upgrading from the previous generation. If, like me, you have a 2011 iMac, you probably aren’t going to rush out for the new iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Nvidia GTX 680MX GPU in the top of the range 27” iMac is a new chip that isn’t even released yet, it looks like it should have around 80% of the performance of the desktop GTX 680 (already one of the fastest GPUs available). There are no longer any Macs that come with AMD Radeon graphics (unless you count the Mac Pro).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have deep pockets, the MacBook Pro 13” with Retinal display is now the best choice laptop for most users, displacing the MacBook Air because of it’s incredible display. It does have some major shortcomings compared to the 15” model, the lack of a quad core processor, 8GB RAM limit, lack of a discrete GPU, but if you can live within those bounds its form factor is very appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mac mini gets some stage time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mac mini has had an interesting update. In the past the updates are unannounced and silently appear on the website, this time Phil Schiller announced a big update to the range with Ivy Bridge, USB3, and a big upgrade to the mid-range model. Previously only the server model came with a quad core processor, and at quite a price premium. Now for £679 you can get a Mac with a CPU as fast as those in the MacBook Pro 15”, and in many ways faster than the current Mac Pros. Add your own SSD and 16GB of RAM and you have a small, compact, but very powerful computer. Just try not to play too many games on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The iPad mini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest surprise of the iPad mini is probably that it’s named iPad mini. That was the only thing left to imagination after all the rumours and leaks. The iPad mini reminds me a lot of the iPod mini’s launch, a smaller and lighter version of an existing product. The reduction in weight will make the biggest difference, my current third generation iPad’s 650g heft is significant and the price to pay for having a retina display. Other advantages include a much smaller battery that will help charging times, and hopefully a longer battery life as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pricing has lead to more questions than answers. It was obvious that Apple couldn’t compete with Google and Amazon by selling the iPad mini at a loss, and their insistence on using high quality materials and not compromising means the iPad mini is fair bit pricier than it’s direct competition. I think Apple will sell its entire inventory of iPad minis for Christmas, they won’t be able to make them fast enough. They still have a massive advantage with their ecosystem, even combining the rest of the market you don’t get close to the quantity and quality that’s available in the App Store and iTunes Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple have decided to maintain their famous profit margin on each device instead of (literally) going for broke like their competitors, I think for the initial iPad mini this is a perfectly shrewd move, but for next years device they may have to be slightly more competitive on price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The new new iPad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well shit, I no longer own the newest iPad and as an insult to injury Apple has slashed the cost of refurbished third generation iPads which means the resale value has also been hit. Do I care? No, the third generation iPad is still a great iPad (although a little CPU constrained), and I’m pleased that Apple is capable of updating their iPads so quickly now. I think this does mean that Apple’s new iPad release schedule is always going to be in the autumn rather than spring, probably to help with seasonal sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did briefly consider selling my third generation iPad for the newer model, but I will probably wait until the new new new iPad that’s now due out in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The presentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each post Steve Jobs presentation, the character and style of Tim Cook and company gets more and more refined. Phil Schiller is really settling into his role in the presentation, and I think he had the best performance of the day. What I would like to see is a bit more secrecy and suspense, there are so many leaks from Apple’s supply line that it’s almost impossible to watch an Apple presentation without knowing the majority of what’s being announced, and that’s a real shame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tweetbot for Mac]]></title><description><![CDATA[The best Twitter app for the Mac is out on the Mac App Store.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s goal should be for Kindle typography to equal print typography. They’re not even close. They get a pass on this only because all their competitors are just as bad or worse. Amazon should hire a world-class book designer to serve as product manager for the Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason I haven’t got a Kindle is the poor typography. That and the fact I don’t read much.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Speculating iPad mini with Retina Display?]]></title><description><![CDATA[1536x1152.

&lt;p&gt;1536x1152.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current iPad is 2048×1536. What if Apple simply used the exact same panels they are currently using in the new 9.7 inch iPad? That would give us a screen at just under 7.3 inches. With everything scaling to 75% hit areas for touch would fall between the iPhone/iPod touch and the current iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds plausible. Just as plausible as a 1024x768 iPad mini.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Motorola's broken promise]]></title><description><![CDATA[Motorola had promised owners of the Photon, Electrify, and Atrix an upgrade to to Android 4.0, known as Ice Cream Sandwich, which would…]]></description><link>https://weiran.co/blog/2012/10/motorolas-broken-promise/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://weiran.co/blog/2012/10/motorolas-broken-promise/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2012 11:45:51 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola had promised owners of the Photon, Electrify, and Atrix an upgrade to to Android 4.0, known as Ice Cream Sandwich, which would bring a host of new features and security updates. Instead they are stuck on Gingerbread, an operating system that was already a year old when Else bought his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems it’s down to a “resourcing issue” and they considered every option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except perhaps paying for more resources?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[TypeScript]]></title><description><![CDATA[Not quite CoffeeScript, but Microsoft’s new TypeScript language claims to be a superset of JavaScript that complies to JavaScript.

&lt;p&gt;It seems like Google is adding stuff to Chrome just to add it. It’s as if they feel like they can’t do nothing feature-wise, so they come up with junk to shove in there, slowing Chrome down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why I use Safari over Chrome on my Mac.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoken turn-by-turn navigation has been a free service offered through Google’s Android mobile OS for a few years now. But it was never part of the deal that brought Google’s Maps to iOS. And sources say Apple very much wanted it to be. Requiring iPhone users to look directly at handsets for directions and manually move through each step — while Android users enjoyed native voice-guided instructions — put Apple at a clear disadvantage in the mobile space. And having chosen Google as its original mapping partner, the iPhone maker was now in a position where an archrival was calling the shots on functionality important to the iOS maps feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this caused Apple — which typically enjoys very tight control over its products — no end of philosophical discomfort, sources say. Apple pushed Google hard to provide the data it needed to bring voice-guided navigation to iOS. But according to people familiar with Google’s thinking, the search giant, which had invested massive sums in creating that data and views it as a key feature of Android, wasn’t willing to simply hand it over to a competing platform.&lt;/p&gt;

The simplicity of the interface, the syncing, and the speed of streaming makes it a joy to use. But if you’re in the UK, you’ll be limited to a much smaller selection of films and TV shows than people in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has released a new iOS 5.1 update to their Apple TV, out of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/article/2010525/hands-on-with-apple-tv-software-update-5-1.html&quot;&gt;many updates&lt;/a&gt; in this release the one that stands out is the ability to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5437&quot;&gt;configuration profiles&lt;/a&gt;. These are usually reserved for corporate deployment and mass configuration, however with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12&quot;&gt;Apple Configuration&lt;/a&gt; app lets anyone with a Mac to create their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get a cheap VPN server hosted in the US, Netflix will now think you’re in the US and offer you their full US library. Before iOS 5.1 for the Apple TV, you had to set this at the router level, and you would’ve sent all your internet traffic through the VPN. With Configuration Profiles only the Apple TV’s internet would be routed through the VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would also get the American football and baseball channels I suppose, but who outside of the US cares about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing to remember is that UI design is like selling a restaurant, where you can’t just serve up good food in order to run a restaurant. You have to create an environment around the food that gets people in the mood to enjoy a really great meal: presenting the food really nicely, picking the right plates, the lighting on the table, the music that is playing. When you put it all that together, it creates a much nicer experience than if you just were to serve up some good food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung has issued a statement that claims this jury verdict is a loss for consumers. But things are more complex than that. There can be no reasonable doubt that Samsung and Google have engaged, and continue to engage, in “copytition” (competing through copying) rather than wholly-independent creation. Somewhere the courts have to draw the line and afford some degree of protection to innovators. I don’t always agree with Apple’s claims, and I don’t like all of Apple’s patents, but the kind of disregard for other companies’ intellectual property that Samsung and Google effectively propose is certainly not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, executives at a Houston airport faced a troubling customer-relations issue. Passengers were lodging an inordinate number of complaints about the long waits at baggage claim. In response, the executives increased the number of baggage handlers working that shift. The plan worked: the average wait fell to eight minutes, well within industry benchmarks. But the complaints persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter will now only permit large services to add value to Twitter, not get any value from it.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Twitter says something like “[developers] will need to work with us” to “identify areas of value” when they get big enough for Twitter to notice, I don’t have high hopes for what “working with us” might actually entail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter clearly see themselves in a strong enough position to be safe from being disrupted. It’s certainly hard to argue against it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Protocols don't mean much]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dave Winer being right again about tent.io:  “Think of a protocol like a road.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fender Stratocaster was released in 1954 and totally changed the then-new electric guitar market. You can look at well-known electric guitar designs like the Telecaster and the Les Paul and just SEE that they were created before the Stratocaster was released. And you can look at a metric fucktonne of electric guitar designs and just SEE that they were created AFTER the Stratocaster was released. There’s a clear point at which the “before Strat” electric guitar industry became the “after Strat” electric guitar industry. The shape of the Fender Stratocaster - influenced by pre-existing stringed instruments like the cello, but still new and unlike any electric guitar made before - became &lt;em&gt;what electric guitars look like&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fender did not pursue the Strat-clone manufacturers in court; and then after attempting to trademark the iconic Statocaster contours decades later, a court ruled in 2009 that “the body shapes were &lt;strong&gt;generic&lt;/strong&gt; and that consumers do not solely associate these shapes with Fender Musical Instruments Corporation”. The ruling went so far as to say “in the case of the [Stratocaster] body outline, **this configuration is so common **that it is depicted as a generic electric guitar in a dictionary.” (bolds mine)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple ain’t making that mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paid full price for every version of the Sparrow app I could find. I told everyone who would listen to buy it. I couldn’t have given them more money even if I wanted to. So, as a customer, what more could I have done to keep them running independently?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the core of the disappointment that many of us feel with the Sparrow acquisition. It’s not about the $15 or less we spent on the apps. It’s not about the team’s well-deserved payout. It’s about the loss of faith in a philosophy that we thought was a sustainable way to ensure a healthy future for independent software development, where most innovation happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t bode well for the current Sparrow apps as we know them. This is almost certainly a talent acquisition by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Sparrow just sent an email to all it’s customers, in it they confirm the Sparrow apps will no longer have any new features released:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to make available our existing products, and we will provide support and critical updates to our users. However, as we’ll be busy with new projects at Google, we do not plan to release new features for the Sparrow apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touch experience isn’t great from my own testing on Windows 8 Release Preview, and it feels all too familiar to Windows 7 — a first stab at touch improvements on desktop software. Microsoft’s Office division has taken a similar approach, by increasing touch targets, but it seems that any truly touch-optimized versions of Office will come as Metro style apps, if anything at all. It’s clearly difficult to create a fully functional touch-based word processor or spreadsheet with legacy support, and Microsoft hasn’t cracked it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I wish I didn’t have to do this, but the “we” Antone mentions at the top of this post does not include me. I don’t stand behind any of this stuff regarding the Retina MBP, personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first series prompted 322 complaints over a story in which a Prime Minister was blackmailed into having sex with a pig live on TV.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooker said: ‘Half of the things in the first run of Black Mirror seem to be on the verge of coming true. They’ve got prisoners in Brazilian prisons pedalling on exercise bikes to reduce their sentences (not entirely dissimilar to the episode 15 Million Merits) and Google Glass looks like copyright infringement as far as The Entire History of You is concerned.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘If the stories from the second run start coming true then we’re REALLY in trouble.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to wonder if this is a preemptive move by Tapbots to gather public support against &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience&quot;&gt;Twitter’s attack on client apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
